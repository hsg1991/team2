"environment, green-living",2017-02-02T12:31:31Z,"Deforestation and extreme weather may later cause earthquakes, scientists believe. Their findings suggest that cutting down trees on steep slopes may increase the risk of not only landslides but earthquakes in heavily deforested places such as Haiti, which suffered a devastating magnitude 7 quake in 2010. Geologists have previously discounted the idea that low atmospheric pressure associated with tropical cyclones can influence the timing of earthquakes. But the new study suggests a different mechanism based on changes to the weight of soil and other ground material bearing down on a geological fault under seismic stress. ""Very wet rain events are the trigger. The heavy rain induces thousands of landslides and severe erosion, which removes ground material from the Earth's surface, releasing the stress and encouraging movement along faults,"" said Shimon Wdowinski of the University of Miami in Florida. ""The 2010 earthquake in Haiti occurred... 18 months after the same area was hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes,"" he said. ""It can happen in other mountainous areas affected by cyclones, such as Japan, the Philippines, and maybe Central America,"" he told the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The idea the weather can play a role in triggering earthquakes is controversial. But Dr Wdowinski said an analysis of the timing of earthquakes and cyclones in Taiwan over the past 60 years has demonstrated a statistical correlation, with a significant number of quakes bigger than 6 occurring within four years of major cyclones – known as typhoons in the Far East. Taiwan was hit in 1969 by Typhoon Flossie, then a 6.2 quake hit Taiwan in 1972. In 2009, Typhoon Morakot was followed by a 6.2 quake in the same year, and a 6.4 quake in 2010. Typhoon Herb, in 1996, was followed by a 6.2 quake in 1998 and a 7.6 quake in 1999. Dr Wdowinski said rapid soil erosion on steep slopes caused by tropical cyclones changed the stress on the geological fault over a period of months or years, which can trigger an earthquake. ""Statistical analysis showed that the timing of the earthquake is above the expected. It is way above background. If it was a random process and there was no relation between earthquakes and cyclones... there was less than 1 per cent probability of this occurring,"" he said. ""It is not that it happens during a cyclone but that there is a delay, and the delay of between three months and three years is due to the ground erosion. The delays can be due to the time it takes for the erosion to wash the material to the ocean,"" he said. An independent analysis of ground movements caused by summer monsoons in the Himalayas also suggested a link between extreme weather and earthquakes. A study by Thomas Ader of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena found that earthquakes were more likely to occur in dry winter months after the monsoon period.

environment,2017-02-02T01:03:42Z,"The renowned American linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky has warned the US Republican party is now “the most dangerous organisation in world history” because of the denial of climate change by President-elect Donald Trump and other leading figures. Following the US elections, Professor Chomsky said it appeared humans planned to answer what he called “the most important question in their history … by accelerating the race to disaster”. Mr Trump has already appointed a prominent climate change denier to run his transition team covering the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other advisers include people with close links to the fossil fuel industry.

Scientists say global warming could hit 7C He has also pledged to scrap the United States’ ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which President Barack Obama has hailed as “the moment that we finally decided to save our planet”. Leading climate scientists have expressed dismay and concern about Mr Trump’s election, suggesting it could be an “unmitigated disaster for the planet”. Speaking to the Truthout website, Professor Chomsky pointed to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which said the past five years had been the hottest on record and reported rising sea levels, unexpectedly rapid melting of ice and other effects of climate change. The election on 8 November had given the Republicans total control of the US government and this meant they had now become ""the most dangerous organisation in world history”, he said.

But is it? The facts suggest otherwise. The party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organised human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand,” Professor Chomsky said. “It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history — whether organised human life will survive in anything like the form we know — and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster.” World reaction to President Trump: In pictures 29 show all World reaction to President Trump: In pictures 1/29 London, England AP 2/29 London, England Reuters 3/29 Manila, Philippines Getty Images 4/29 Manila, Philippines Getty 5/29 Mosul , Iraq Getty 6/29 Manila, Philippines AP 7/29 New Delhi, India Reuters 8/29 Karachi, Pakistan EPA 9/29 Jakarta, Indonesia Reuters 10/29 Lagos, Nigeria AP 11/29 Kabul, Afghanistan AP 12/29 Jerusalem.

Tens of millions of people living in Bangladesh alone are expected to lose their homes to the rising sea over the coming decades. Professor Chomsky said a leading scientist there had suggested “with considerable justice” that the climate refugees should have the right to move to countries responsible for the greenhouse gases that had created the problem. “These catastrophic consequences can only increase, not just in Bangladesh, but in all of South Asia as temperatures, already intolerable for the poor, inexorably rise and the Himalayan glaciers melt, threatening the entire water supply,” he said.  “Already in India, some 300 million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water. And the effects will reach far beyond.” Professor Chomsky said he could hardly believe climate change had been so little discussed during the election campaign. “It is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza, none of this receives more than passing mention,” he said. “At least I am at a loss to find appropriate words.” More about: climate change Global Warming Donald Trump Noam Chomsky Republican Party Reuse content",1.3,independent.co.uk,2016-11-15,Noam Chomsky: Donald Trump's election will accelerate global warming and humanity's 'race to disaster',/environment/noam-chomsky-donald-trump-climate-change-denier-global-warming-race-to-disaster-republicans-most-a7418296.html,5892856e88e7feb8ecbb8811
environment,2017-02-02T01:28:50Z,"The prospect of the global warming “conspiracy theorist” Donald Trump becoming the next US president cast a shadow over the start of talks at the United Nations climate summit in Morocco on Monday, with claims his election could result in “planetary disaster”. The conference is seen as one which must turn the promises made at Paris last year into concrete action if the world is to avoid a shift to a particularly dangerous new climate. However Mr Trump has described the Paris Agreement as “unbelievable”, promising to remove the US from its signatories, and also bizarrely claimed global warming is a hoax perpetrated by China. China faced criticism in the past for its reliance on coal, but has recently become the world leader for investment in renewable energy. Khalid Pitts, national political director of the US environmental group the Sierra Club, said in a statement: “World leaders change, but Donald Trump’s total ignorance of science remains the same.  Read more World facing apocalyptic future of famine, war and disease, UN warns How rich countries avoid helping world’s poor cope with climate change China slams Trump’s plan to back out of climate change agreement Americans more scared of clowns than climate change “Electing a climate science conspiracy theorist like Trump would make America a global laughingstock and embarrassment, all while relinquishing our leadership role in the world. “The ice caps don’t negotiate, and neither do rising seas. Donald Trump’s moral failure to acknowledge the climate crisis might very well mean planetary disaster if he is elected.” However Segolene Royal, the French environment minister, pointed out that the United States’ swift ratification of the Paris treaty – announced at a joint ceremony with China – meant Mr Trump would not be able to scrap it immediately. “The Paris agreement prohibits any exit for a period of three years, plus a year-long notice period, so there will be four stable years,” she said.

The Republican candidate has made repeated comments on Twitter spelling out his view that climate change is a massive conspiracy. “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,” he wrote in 2012.

"environment, nature",2017-02-02T04:21:01Z,"Britain’s most endangered species have declined by almost 60 per cent since the 1970s, according to a new Government tool launched to track the nation’s wildlife. Click image above to enlarge graphic The official analysis looks at the how the populations of more than 200 native species – including birds, bats, moths, butterflies, hares and dormice – have changed over the last 40 years. While the Government has previously published statistics for individual wildlife groups, this is the first time it has pulled together information on all the nation’s “priority” wildlife at the same time. The new index has described as a “FTSE Index for threatened wildlife” . The new statistics reveal that priority species have declined on average by 58 per cent since 1970. The government has described this as a “statistically significant decrease”. Around 70 per cent of the priority species have declined in the last forty years, according to the new data, which shows that moth species have faced the hardest time – declining in abundance by around 88 per cent. Climate change and habitat loss are thought to be key factors, according to experts. Butterfly numbers have also declined by around 40 per cent compared to 1970 levels. Richard Gregory, head of species monitoring at the RSPB, said the new indicator showed a “steady and very worrying decline”. But he added that this could be improved with the new indicator. “What this new official biodiversity statistic does is act as an indicator of the health of our countryside. Every year the Government will be publishing these figures in the same way that they publish school league tables and crime statistics.” He added: “We hope they will be a powerful new tool in the fight to halt the loss of our threatened native wildlife.”  Thanks to conservation efforts, bird populations have fared better than the invertebrates, with population numbers increasing by an average of around 17 per cent over the last forty years. The osprey, red kite, white-tailed eagle and marsh harrier have done particularly well, according to the index.  Mammals have also seen an estimated 16 per cent increase.  Several species groups have not been included, including amphibians, reptiles, fish, fungi or plants. But conservationists estimate that the latter are not faring much better, with 97 per cent of the UK’s wild flower meadows lost and one in five of all UK flowering plants species threatened with extinction. Mr Gregory added that the RSPB will be working with the Government to ensure that data for these species can be included in future to “build a full picture of the state of our wildlife”. The State of Nature report published earlier this year found that 60 per cent of UK species assessed were in decline, with over one in ten threatened with distinction. Joan Edwards, head of living seas at The Wildlife Trust, said she hoped “this official indicator for priority species takes that one step further and ensures that the problems facing our native species are factored into Government decision-making”. A Defra spokesperson said biodiversity indicators had seen improvements, including increasing bat and wintering water-bird populations, as well as air quality improvements and increased protection at sea. She added: “More is being done to protect our wildlife than ever before and the latest indicators show that we are making improvements. We’ve invested £7.5m to create Nature Improvement Areas, more farmland is now managed for wildlife and more of our seas are protected.” Reuse content",1.3,independent.co.uk,2013-10-24,Natural disaster: Government's new index reveals huge decline for Britain’s most endangered wildlife,/environment/nature/natural-disaster-governments-new-index-reveals-huge-decline-for-britain-s-most-endangered-wildlife-8902574.html,5892b3ad88e7feba73e00866
environment,2017-02-02T05:52:15Z,"It is an awe-inspiring and terrifying sight, a volcano spewing lava and millions of tons of ash and rock into a blackened sky. Mexico’s “fire volcano”, Mount Colima, recently began erupting … again, a reminder of the spectacularly destructive forces that can be unleashed by nature. But dramatic as online footage of this Mexican volcano is, the eruption is a mere trifle compared to some of the little-known natural disasters that have been predicted. From supervolcanoes to towering megatsunamis, these catastrophic events could affect millions – and occur sooner than you think. 1. Indonesia’s forgotten supervolcano The threat posed to the world by the Yellowstone supervolcano in the United States is well documented. Less well-known (or acknowledged), however, is that it is just one of many posing a catastrophic threat to the planet. The Lake Toba supervolcano, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, is currently home to the largest volcanic lake on Earth, formed 74,000 years ago when it last blew in the biggest eruption for 25m years. It is estimated that around 2,800 cubic kilometres of volcanic ash and lava were thrown into the atmosphere, 12% more than was ejected by the last Yellowstone eruption of 2.2m years ago.

As with any super-eruption, the vast quantities of ash and sulphur dioxide produced can have a devastating effect on the global climate. But a number of factors make the prospect of a Toba super-eruption much more intimidating than one at Yellowstone. Toba is located on the densely populated island of Sumatra, home to over 50m vulnerable people, and is only 40km from the Indian Ocean in which catastrophic tsunamis (of which we have recent experience) would certainly be generated. Additionally, in recent months, reports of volcanic gases and heating of the ground surface have led to suggestions that the sleeping giant may again be waking up. A waiting game: Lake Tabo Supervolcano. Flickr/SK Ding, CC BY 2. The Hilina Slump Forget the widely-publicised megatsunami threat that has been attributed to the potential collapse of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma in the Canary Islands. A far greater danger is posed by the possible collapse of the southern portion of Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. Termed the Hilina Slump, this could drop 12,000 cubic kilometres of rock into the Pacific Ocean, generating a megatsunami that would propagate around the Pacific Ocean and reach the western seaboard of North America in a matter of hours, inundating coastal communities. There is evidence that a similar collapse at nearby Mauna Loa around 120,000 years ago generated a tsunami with a run-up height of over 400m. Even as recently as 1975, movement of the Hilina Slump generated a smaller, yet destructive tsunami that reached California. Given that the slump is continually active and moving, it might only take a jolt from an earthquake in the tectonically active state to set in motion this catastrophic chain of events. 3. The North Sea Tsunami The North Sea may seem an unlikely place for a devastating tsunami but climate change has led to concern that a submarine landslide in the region might lead to just this. There is a precedent. Scientists have suggested that over 6,000 years ago, a sharp sea-level rise, attributed to a changing climate and a rapid melting of ice, added weight to the submarine glacial deposits at the edge of the Norwegian continental shelf, destabilising them and causing a 300km long landslide. This generated a tsunami that reached heights of up to 20 metres in the Shetland Islands, ten on the Norwegian coast and six metres off the northern and western coast of Scotland. Should Earth experience such a rapidly warming climate again, and experience the associated melting of the Greenland and/or West Antarctic ice sheets, a similar event might well be possible which, today, would affect the coastal populations of Scotland and Norway (around 3m) – and perhaps even London. 4. The Cascadian ‘Big One’ At the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, just off the west coast of North America and running from northern California to Vancouver Island, is a subduction zone – a place where the Pacific Ocean floor is being forced beneath the North American landmass. The rate of movement of the ocean floor here is currently just 40mm a year but the upper part of the system is currently stuck, meaning that the North American plate is being compressed. At some point, the pressure being built up has to be released and this will be in the form of a massive earthquake, perhaps up to a magnitude 9. This could cause subsidence of the coastal region of up to 2m and a possible horizontal displacement of 30m. Shortly after the intense shaking subsides, the riling coastal community will be struck by a tsunami that could dwarf that of the 2011 Japanese wave. Around 7m people live in this region, from Vancouver, though Seattle, to Tacoma and Portland. How feasible is it? Well scientists have calculated that in the last 10,000 years, the region has suffered 41 large earthquakes, occurring with an average interval of 244 years – the last was a magnitude 9 and that was 315 years ago. Solar flare: The sun harbours a hidden danger NASA/SDO/AIA, CC BY 5. An extra-terrestrial threat Perhaps the biggest threat to the modern world is posed by our own star. Periodically, the sun emits a solar flare, an intense cloud of energetic photons and particles with the energy of millions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once. Once released, these clouds arrive at Earth’s upper atmosphere within a day or two and, in many cases, most ordinary people on Earth would be none the wiser. If intense enough, however, a solar storm could devastate electrical systems both in orbit, for example, satellites, and on the ground, as the energetic electrons cause a charge build-up. One of the largest known events was in 1921, which knocked out the US telegraph service; but scientists have calculated that should a similar event happen in today’s technology-reliant society, it could knock out many satellite systems, disabling global communications, the internet and the global positioning system. Chaos could ensue. The intensity of solar flares varies on a roughly 11-year cycle and fortunately, 2014 saw the most recent peak come and go without significant impact. We can only hope that the same can be said for the future.

"environment, nature",2017-02-02T05:55:12Z,"The exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, which was evacuated in 1986 after a devastating explosion and fire, has become a wildlife haven on a par with heavily-protected nature reserves, scientists have found. A detailed survey of the huge forested area around the stricken plant has revealed that it is teeming with large animals such elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar and wolves despite being contaminated with radioactive fallout This doesn’t mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming and forestry, are a lot worse Professor Jim Smith, Portsmouth University The scientists found no evidence to support earlier studies suggesting that wildlife in the region had suffered from the radiation released after the Chernobyl accident of 1986 which sent plumes of radioactive emissions across much of northern Europe, causing radiation “hotspots” within the exclusion zone. Fox makes huge sandwich Following the disaster, more than 116,000 local residents were evacuated from the zone around Chernobyl, which covers some 4,200 square kilometres (1,622 square miles), with only key construction workers and nuclear staff allowed into the site to safeguard the stricken reactors. The absence of human activity in the exclusion zone has benefited the wildlife of the region more than any possible damage it may have suffered as a result of coming into contact with radioactive elements, the researchers said. The population of wolves in the exclusion zone was found to be seven times higher than in nature reserves “It’s very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident. This doesn’t mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming and forestry, are a lot worse,” said Professor Jim Smith of Portsmouth University, who led the study.

They found no evidence to suggest that any species of mammal had been adversely affected by the nuclear fallout. “These results demonstrate for the first time that, regardless of potential radiation effects on individual animals, the Chernobyl exclusion zone supports an abundant mammal community after nearly three decades of chronic radiation exposure,” the researchers write in their study published in the journal Current Biology. While the numbers of elk and wild boar, for instance, were undergoing rapid decline in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the corresponding populations in the exclusion zone were increasing, the researchers found.  Numbers of elk declined rapidly in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union The population of wolves in the exclusion zone was also found to be about seven times higher than in corresponding nature reserves in the region, they said.

"environment, nature",2017-02-02T10:11:15Z,"One-fifth of the world's invertebrates, ""the little things that run the world,"" may be heading for extinction, according to the Zoological Society of London. The society (ZSL) suggests that about 20 per cent of the world's insects, spiders, worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other animals without backbones are endangered, for reasons ranging from pollution and over-harvesting to the effect of invasive species. The report, entitled ""Spineless"", and produced in conjunction with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles the Red List of threatened species, is the first attempt at estimating the global conservation status of invertebrates. Invertebrates constitute almost 80 per cent of the world's 1.9 million known species and display staggering diversity, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to giant squid which can reach 18 metres in length. But much less attention is paid to them than to vertebrate animals, which include mammals, birds, fish and reptiles, and are far fewer in number (totalling about 60,000 species). And this is the case even though invertebrates are crucial in maintaining ecosystems – without insects, for example, we would lose much of the pollination services upon which agriculture depends, and without earthworms, the processes that spread organic matter through soil would be disrupted. Two years ago, an earlier study suggested that a fifth of all vertebrates were facing extinction, and today's report puts the conservation status of the smaller and more numerous invertebrate animals at the same level. Threatened species in Britain include the brilliantly-coloured ladybird spider, once thought extinct and clinging on in Dorset and the freshwater pear mussel, famous for its pearls and now confined to a handful of rivers. Also at risk is the white-clawed crayfish, which has been ousted from many of its haunts by an American crayfish species. Others at risk in the UK include the shrill carder bee, the tansy beetle and the bog hoverfly, found only on Dartmoor. The new report was carried out by analysing the 12,000 invertebrate species whose conservation status has been investigated and assessed by the IUCN, and projecting the threat across all species. It found that the highest risk of extinction tends to be associated with species that are less mobile and are only found in small geographical areas. For example, vertebrate amphibians and invertebrate freshwater molluscs both face high levels of threat – around one third of species. In contrast, invertebrate species which are more mobile like dragonflies and butterflies face a similar threat to that of birds, and around one tenth of species are at risk. ""Invertebrates constitute almost 80 per cent of the world's species, and a staggering one in five species could be at risk of extinction,"" said Dr Ben Collen, of the ZSL. The society's director of conservation, Professor Jonathan Baillie, added: ""We knew that roughly one fifth of vertebrates and plants were threatened with extinction, but it was not clear if this was representative of the small spineless creatures that make up the majority of life on the planet. ""The initial findings indicate that 20 per cent of all species may be threatened. This is particularly concerning as we are dependent on these spineless creatures for our very survival."" At risk: Bugs' lives Bog hoverfly (Eristalis cryptarum) A rare hoverfly that in recent years has been found only within a restricted area of Dartmoor. Shrill carder bee (Bombus sylvarum) Threatened by loss of the extensive flower-rich areas and suitable nesting sites of long tussocky grass it needs to survive. Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) Facing threats from illegal pearl fishing – 75 per cent of the species' sites have been damaged by criminals. Tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) Once widespread, but dependent for its sole food source on the tansy plant, which is declining.

"environment, nature",2017-02-02T10:47:01Z,"The quiet town of Barton-upon-Humber in north Lincolnshire has three rather dangerous guests. Two black widow spiders, including a deadly female, and a brown widow were captured by staff at an engineering firm after scuttling out of US-imported aircraft engines and surprising workers who were stripping the engines down. The men caught all three of the venomous creatures by placing glasses from their works canteen over them and using pieces of cardboard to trap them – without realising that a single bite could be fatal. They are now keeping them alive in jam jars and an office display case on a table in the engineering works, feeding them flies and smaller spiders. The spiders, which travelled over from Kansas with the engines on a KLM flight and aboard a North Sea ferry, will probably end up in a British wildlife park. On Monday morning supervisor Matt Eales, Dan and Dave Peacock, Darren Elliott and Dave Holden – who said they had never encountered anything worse than harmless house spiders in imported engines – lay underneath the two old 747 engines and started working on them with spanners. Mr Holden, 48, from Lincoln, said: ""I noticed this spider come scuttling out while one of my colleagues was on the floor, under the fan case. He said: 'Look at the size of that thing.' I said: 'That is not a normal spider.' It was only a foot away from his head while he was spannering away. We got a glass from the canteen area of the workshop and put it over it with a piece of card underneath it and tied some cloth around it."" Staff later identified the spider as a female black widow from its distinctive red markings. Later that afternoon, a male black widow emerged, and on Tuesday the team came into work to find a third spider, a slightly less venomous brown widow, hanging from its web off the side of one of the engines. Stuart Elliott, the managing director of the company, TC Power, said: ""It is quite scary when you think we have had three or four people lying around underneath the engines, working within five or six inches of the frames where we found the first female black widow. ""We have had common or garden house spiders on engine frames when they have come in from abroad but nothing as deadly as this,"" he added. ""We pulled the guys off the job, had a risk assessment and consulted north Lincolnshire environmental health."" Mr Holden added: ""We are pretty confident there are no more about. They have inspected the frames and looked inside and can't see any more. All you can do is have a laugh about it and get on with it."" Craig Gledhill, the zoo manager of the Jungle Zoo in Cleethorpes, said of the female black widow: ""It would be a very serious incident if a healthy human were to be bitten. But if they were to receive quite swift medical treatment they would probably survive... if the individual was elderly or a small child, or anyone with a heart or respiratory problem, then they would be in great danger from the neurotoxic of the venom.""
