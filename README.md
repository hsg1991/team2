Team project description:

# Motivation
- Newspapers have their own editorial policy
- By the editorial policy, the content and the attitude of news articles can be differed
- We want to explore what disasters the UK medias are interest in and how the medias handle the disasters in their articles, especially in environmental disaster

# Research Questions
- How to find the articles related to environmental disaster?

: We did an exploratory analysis and made some rules to select the disaster-related news

- How to analyze the difference between how media report the same issues (e.g. environmental disaster)?

: We performed topic modelling and sentiment analysis on the disaster-related news
