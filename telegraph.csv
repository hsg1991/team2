The drama began when the 47,000 tonne Liberian-flagged Rena struck the Astrolabe reef, 12 nautical miles from the North Island port of Tauranga. Fuel oil began leaking from pipes ruptured when the ship ground on to the sharp rocks in the middle of the night, ripping a huge gash in the bow. The 25 crew on board were unhurt. Officials who scrambled to the scene now fear the ship will break up, with weather conditions expected to deteriorate over the weekend.

An international salvage expert flew to Tauranga from the Netherlands to advise on the operation. Nick Smith, the Environment Minister, warned: ""This has the potential to be New Zealand's most significant maritime pollution disaster in decades."" The pristine area is renowned for an abundance of marine life, including whales, dolphins, marlin, seals and rare turtles. Several seabirds have already been found dead and a wildlife emergency response team has been set up. Andrew Berry of Maritime New Zealand, the government agency that controls shipping, said he was very worried about the threat posed by the wreck. ""It has the potential to be very, very serious indeed, simply because of the age of the ship, the damage that she's sustained, and the 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil on board,"" he said. Maritime New Zealand said it had not yet been possible to deploy oil-containing booms in the open waters of the Bay of Plenty. Witnesses described the oil slick, which continues to expand, as a thick brown sludge and said there was a strong smell of diesel. The Rena, which is stacked up to eight-high with shipping containers, is listing dangerously to port. Up to half of the 21-year-old ship is firmly lodged on the reef, the rest is floating on the water. Matthew Watson, a spokesman for the Dutch firm Svitzer Salvage who were called in by the ship's owners, said the operation was extremely delicate. Transferring oil from the Rena to another ship and unloading its containers would dramatically affect the balance of the vessel, he said.",588e91a7ee4241e81d52bfe8

Zoltan Bakonyi, head of the Hungarian Aluminium Production and Trade Company (MAL), was arrested by police yesterday on suspicion of public endangerment and environmental damage. Mr Orban also called for it to come under state control and its assets frozen until the investigation into the disaster had run its course. ""In light of what happened, we have good reason to believe that there were people who were aware of the dangerously weakened state of the walls of the reservoirs, but driven by their private interests they believed they were not worth repairing and hoped that the trouble could be avoided,"" the prime minister told parliament. He said that he believed the disaster was caused by ""human negligence"".

Zoltan Illes, the Hungarian environment minister, warned MAL could face a fine of up to £64 million, if it had broken the law. ""We still don't know for now whether the company overloaded the reservoirs or not. But if that is the case, it's illegal storage of waste and that constitutes a crime,"" he said. Mr Illes explained that the environmental damage to the area's water systems alone could amount to GBP 32 million while other costs could double the figure. As evidence of possible negligence the World Wildlife Fund released aerial pictures taken three months ago appearing to show red sludge seeping through the northern wall of the reservoir and into a neighbouring drainage channel. ""There must have been a serious leakage back in June, and the company and the authorities should have known that there was something seriously wrong with the structure,"" Gabor Figeczky, acting director of the fund's Budapest office, told The Daily Telegraph. In its defence MAL issued a statement Monday saying that it had ""strictly observed technical regulations"" and had invested millions of pounds in maintenance work and renovation. It also stated that it had presented regular reports on the condition of the site to the authorities. At the reservoir, emergency workers were racing to complete new damns, after Mr Illes said that another collapse of the reservoir's walls was ""inevitable"". Tibor Dobson, head of the disaster relief team on the site, said that the first damn should be completed by the end of Monday, while two other dykes were also under construction. Officials fear that heavy rain forecast for this week could further weaken the reservoir's walls.",588e96c2ee4241366b6598f0
