One carriage containing 31,500 litres of the acid is currently leaking into Horse Creek, near Mount Isa, but it is not known how much sulphuric acid has entered the waterway. 'We are in the process of monitoring the water and determining the damage caused by the sulphuric acid,' police Inspector Trevor Kidd told Daily Mail Australia. The 27 carriage train which de-railed on December 27 was carrying 819,000 litres of sulphuric acid 'It's been leaking around the wreckage and into Horse Creek from the site,' he said. 'Initially there was no impact on the creek but more recently there's been some impact.' 'That is why we are testing the water up to 8km away from the site.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The best New Year's Eve weather in forever! Australia... From stubbed toes and sore hands to bad dreams: Just 10 PER... Share this article Share The sulphuric acid could change the ph balance of the water, and lead to the small fish species which live in the creek to die.  If the contamination is high enough it could also have a devastating effect on livestock.  'Obviously the biggest impact is closest to the site.'  'That is why we have a team of people from the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection working near the site, conducting tests.'  A 2km exclusion zone has been formed around the site so environmental tests can be done Sulphuric acid is extremely corrosive so the scientists must use strict PPE while monitoring the site. An emergency declaration has been made for the wreckage, which includes a 2km exclusion zone.  The exclusion zone is expected to be ongoing until the wreckage has been cleared and any danger caused by the leaking acid to be rectified. 'We don't know how long it will take to clear the area, it will depend on the EHP's findings.' It is thought that just one of the 27 train carriages is leaking. 'Initially we knew of one carriage leaking, but it could be more, and we will know that once the crews have been able to monitor the area.' The chemical is highly corrosive, these men are helping to construct an exclusion zone so test can be done on the site Rain in the area has slowed-down the efforts of emergency services working on the crash site, as many roads including the Flinders Highway closed due to flooding.  The rain could also have an impact how far the pollution caused by the acid could spread.  Horse Creek is a slow-flowing waterway, however more rain could lead to the acid spreading over the flat flood plains in the area. Julia Creek Mayor, Anthony Batt, told the ABC that he is pleased that only one carriage appears to be leaking. 'I think we're probably all up in a reasonable positive position, because there's 820,000 [litres] all together and we may have lost 31,000 [litres], but that's yet to be confirmed. 'It's just an initial flow-on into a dam that's really close, that is not so good.  'We have been talking to the three properties involved but all you can really tell them initially is 'Just be careful with your water source', because we still don't know the size of the leak,' he said. Construction workers have spent the past few days laying walkways over the flooded site so chemical specialists can reach the wreckage. Sulphuric acid can have a negative effect on animal life depending on its concentration Helicopter crews are assisting with the contamination threat by distributing limestone over the area to neutralise the acid. Sandbags will also line the wreckage to stop the spread of the chemical. The train, which had three crew members, was destined to reach Phosphate Hill, a local mine, from Townsville when it crashed.  The crew members suffered minor injuries and taken to hospital but were cleared shortly after being admitted.  The location of the accidents is 20kms from Julia Creek, and 3 hours from Mount Isa.    ",588e9848ee4241648d2004f1

Scroll down for video  A massive gas leak is erupting from an energy facility in Aliso Canyon, California, causing one of the biggest environmental disasters in US history. A video taken last week by an Earthworks ITC-certified thermographer shows a geyser of methane gas come out from the Earth HOW CAN SOCAL PLUG THE LEAK? Michael Mizrahi, a spokesperson for SoGal Gas, said the company is drilling a relief well. This well is designed to intercept and plug the damaged well, and could be completed by late February or late March 'The relief well drilling process is expected to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week,' he said. 'A second relief well is being prepared as a backup operation, and drilling is expected to begin in January.' He added the possibility of pumping fluids directly down the affected well to stop the flow of gas was also under consideration. Motherboard notes that plugging the leak is tricky because the base of the well sits 8,000 feet underground. Workers have been' unable to establish a stable enough column of fluid to keep the force of gas coming up from the reservoir.' The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who released the footage, described it 'one of the biggest leaks we've ever seen reported' and 'absolutely uncontained'.  Aerial images for the first time also reveal the damage at the location of the well, a site that has been heavily restricted due to safety concerns.  Methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, can be flammable under high pressures and inflict immediate climate damage. 'Events of this size are rare, but major leakage across the oil and gas supply chain is not. There are plenty of mini -Aliso Canyons that add up to a big climate problem – not just in California, but across the country,' said Tim O'Connor, Director of Environmental Defense Fund's California Oil and Gas Program. A digital counter developed by EDF tracks the leak using state data to estimate its real-time climate impact.  Current estimates indicate the near-term climate damage of the leak is the same as driving 7 million cars a year, or equal to all of the annual pollution from California's oil refineries combined.  Nationally, the problem of industrial methane pollution is estimated to be over 7 million tons per year. Locals are now starting to file lawsuits against the company that owns the facility, Southern California Gas (SoCal Gas), and more than 2,000 families have been relocated. According to a report in Motherboard, SoCal Gas said that plugging the leak, would take at least three more months.

Share this article Share 2.2k shares The leak currently accounts for a quarter of the state's entire methane emissions 'Our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful, so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well,' Anne Silva, a spokesperson for the Southern California Gas Company, told Motherboard. 'The relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late February or late March.' Motherboard notes that plugging the leak is tricky because the base of the well sits 8,000 feet underground.

Pictured is the site of the leak in Aliso Canyon, LA This image shows the flow of electricity (figures 1 and 2) to SoCal Gas' natural gas storage facility in LA where the gas is stored deep underground. When needed, natural gas is withdrawn from the storage facility and deliver through their network of pipelines Pumping fluids into the well currently isn't working, SoCal Gas has said. Workers have been' unable to establish a stable enough column of fluid to keep the force of gas coming up from the reservoir.' The company is now building a relief well that will connect to the leaking well to reduce the pressure and block the leak. Under a court-ordered settlement reached this week between the gas company and Los Angeles city attorneys, SoCal Gas must find temporary housing within 72 hours for any residents of Porter Ranch who ask to be relocated. As of Wednesday, the company said it had relocated 2,147 families in temporary housing, while hundreds more have left the area on their own. The gated community, located some 30 miles (48km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, sits near one of the largest natural gas storage fields in the US, where a leak was detected on October 23. SoCal insists that it poses no danger to human health as methane dissipates quickly into the air. But many families report falling ill from the fumes - with symptoms including nose bleeds and nausea - and have filed a class action suit against the company and pulled their children from area schools. Locals are now starting to file lawsuits against the company that owns the facility, Southern California Gas (SoCal Gas), and more than 2,000 families have been relocated Trucks enter the gates of Southern California Gas Company property where Aliso Canyon Storage Field is located in the of the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California Residents also fear that property values in the area - described by the local council as an idyllic 'dream' community - will plummet because of the leak. The Los Angeles city attorney earlier this month filed suit against SoCal Gas saying that no community 'should have to endure what the residents of Porter Ranch have suffered from the gas company's continued failure to stop the leak.' 'It's not only the odor, it's the potential health consequences from the long-term exposure to chemicals like benzene,' attorney Mike Feuer added. According to the California Air Resources Board, the leak is releasing between 44,000 and 58,000 kilograms (97,000 and 127,000 pounds) of methane into the air per hour. HELIUM LEAKING FROM A FAULT IN LA COULD TRIGGER THE 'BIG ONE' Methane isn't the only gas threatening the well-being of residents in LA.  Helium leaking from massive earthquake fault under Los Angeles reveals giant rift.  A huge fault in the Earth's crust near Los Angeles is leaking helium, researchers have found. They say the unexpected find sheds new light on the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone in the Los Angeles Basin. It reveals the fault is far deeper than previously thought, and a quake would be far more devastating. It follows a report from the U.S. Geological Survey has warned the risk of 'the big one' hitting California has increased dramatically. A geologic cross section of the Los Angeles Basin from the southwest to northeast. This profile intersects the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone at Long Beach UC Santa Barbara geologist Jim Boles found evidence of helium leakage from the Earth's mantle along a 30-mile stretch of the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone in the Los Angeles Basin.  Using samples of casing gas from two dozen oil wells ranging from LA's Westside to Newport Beach in Orange County, Boles discovered that more than one-third of the sites show evidence of high levels of helium-3 (3He). 'The results are unexpected for the area, because the LA Basin is different from where most mantle helium anomalies occur,' said Boles, professor emeritus in UCSB's Department of Earth Science. 'The Newport-Inglewood fault appears to sit on a 30-million-year-old subduction zone, so it is surprising that it maintains a significant pathway through the crust.' 'Our findings indicate that the Newport-Inglewood fault is a lot more important than previously thought, but time will tell what the true importance of all this is.' The last estimate on December 22 showed 30,300 kilograms of methane released per hour. The board estimates that the leak is so large that it has increased the West Coast state's greenhouse gas output by 25 percent - this in a state that prides itself on being an environmental leader nationwide. The Federal Aviation Administration has meanwhile banned aircraft flights over the area as a precaution. A spokesman for SoCal Gas said that the company's priority was to stop the leak while addressing the needs of the community and the environmental impact. The spokesperson, Michael Mizrahi said the relief well being drilled to intercept and plug the damaged well - at more than 8,000 feet underground - could be completed by late February or late March 'The relief well drilling process is expected to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week,' he said. SoCal Gas said that plugging the leak, would take at least three more months. The leak is spewing from their facility in Aliso Canyon.  The source of the leak is a pipe in a 7-inch casing of well that is 8,750 feet deep 'A second relief well is being prepared as a backup operation, and drilling is expected to begin in January.' He added the possibility of pumping fluids directly down the affected well to stop the flow of gas was also under consideration. Attorney Matthew McNicholas, who has filed suit on behalf of several Porter Ranch families, said the gas company had acted recklessly by not informing the community immediately as to the nature and extent of the leak and by not implementing appropriate safety measures. 'SoCal Gas did not maintain their facility properly, leading to issues involving the health and safety of residents and the community at large,' he said in a statement. 'They created the conditions allowing the well to fail, causing children and families to suffer.' SoCal Gas has yet to respond to DailyMail.com for comment.

Dare investors take a bet on fracking? By Dan Hyde Published: 23:36 GMT, 18 December 2012 | Updated: 17:34 GMT, 21 December 2012 e-mail 14 View comments Britain may be on the brink of an energy revolution that could help millions of families with the soaring cost of heating their homes. Last week the Government gave the green light to a controversial gas-drilling technique called fracking. Ministers hope this will cut our dependence on Russian and Saudi oil, and help to keep energy bills lower in the UK. Enlarge   Shale gas: Could cut our dependence on Russian and Saudi oil, and help to keep energy bills lower in the UK All six major gas and electricity suppliers have added around £100 to annual household bills this winter, partly blaming the rising cost of fossil fuels. So, if fracking really is the answer to our energy problems, could it present an opportunity for bold investors to cash in on pioneering UK firms? Jason Hollands, managing director of financial adviser Bestinvest, says: ‘Fracking is the big story in energy at the moment — and it’s already had a major impact in the U.S. ‘Undoubtedly, it could become a real growth area in the UK, and that will whet the appetites of investors who like to take risks.’   More... Investing ideas: The art of keeping it simple and why I've put money in Fundsmith MIDAS SHARE TIPS: Bug killing can boost veteran firm Bioquell whose history runs from plumbing Balmoral to state-of-the-art defence Fracking works by sending a drill 10,000 ft into the earth to a shallow layer of rock, called shale. A pump then fires millions of  gallons of water, sand and chemicals at the earth to create small explosions. The splitting rock releases gas which escapes up a pipe to the surface. An estimated 300 trillion cubic feet of untapped shale gas lies under two-thirds of the country — enough to supply Britain’s energy for 120 years. So far, the only company with a permit to dig in the UK is Cuadrilla. But when its engineers were drilling five miles east of Blackpool last year, a series of mini earthquakes occurred. The Government suspended all fracking until the Department for Energy and Climate Change had investigated the dangers. Eighteen months later, shale gas extraction has been given the  all-clear — albeit under strict new rules. Any drilling must stop immediately if tremors larger than 0.5 magnitude are registered — equal to a hand grenade exploding. However, concerns remain — particularly over toxic fracking chemicals leaking into drinking water supplies. The huge water wastage will also cause consternation if there is a hosepipe ban next year. Wells in Colorado in the U.S., for example, guzzle enough water to supply a whole city for a year. Other worries include acres of countryside being turned into an industrial wasteland plagued by noisy lorries. Environmentalists complain that the vast amounts of energy used get only a little extra back. They want money spent on wind, wave and solar power, instead of a gas which will one day run out. And, for ordinary investors, cashing in on fracking might not be easy. Patrick Connolly, an independent financial adviser at wealth manager AWD Chase de Vere, says: ‘This is so new that there are only a handful of shares ordinary investors can buy. ‘However, I would urge immense caution — it is extremely risky to invest in small fracking firms at this stage.’ Most UK producers — including Cuadrilla — are privately owned and off-limits to ordinary savers. One of the few with shares you can buy is iGas Energy, which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) for small start-ups. Last week’s announcement pushed up its price 8 pc. A single investment in such a comparatively small company at this early stage could be very risky indeed. An alternative is BG Group — the exploration firm which was once part of British Gas — but fracking plays only a minor role at the FTSE-100 firm. Probably a better investment opportunity lies with companies with links to fracking — for example, Weir Group, which makes the pumps and drill parts. The safest way to invest is a fund that will hold a mixture of shares to spread the risk. Tim Cockerill, head of investment at wealth manager Rowan Dartington, says: ‘A fund has a manager monitoring the newsflow to buy and sell when the time is right. This is vital in a young industry such as fracking — and hard for most savers to do on their own.’ Weir Group is the largest holding in the AXA Framlington UK Select Opportunities fund, which has turned £10,000 into £13,535 in five years, according to data analyst Morningstar. A more direct investment is Artemis Global Energy — a relatively new fund. This higher-risk fund allows savers to benefit from a fracking boom across the globe, Mr Hollands says. In the U.S., for example, shale gas production has leapt from 0.3 trillion cubic feet in 1996 to 7.8 trillion last year. The Artemis fund invests £3.30 in every £100 of savers’ money in Occidental Petroleum, the largest gas producer in California. It has turned £10,000 into £10,201 over the past year, with money also spread to African and Norwegian oil explorers and U.S. petrol companies such as Exxon and Hollyfrontier.",589379ceee4241ce6754049e
