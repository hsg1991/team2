The unnamed man, who was diagnosed with leukaemia in January 2014 after feeling unwell, spent a year working on reactor buildings that were badly damaged after a magnitude 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck Fukushima and other parts of Japan’s north-east coast on 11 March 2011. The disaster caused a triple meltdown at the nuclear plant, where so far almost 45,000 workers have been involved in a cleanup and decommissioning effort that is expected to cost billions of dollars and take about 40 years. Safe at last? View from Naraha – the first Fukushima community declared fit for humans Read more Tuesday’s announcement by Japan’s health ministry will come as a blow to Fukushima’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), and could frustrate government efforts to encourage people to return to communities nearby that have been declared safe. Media reports said the man, an employee of one of the myriad contractors employed by Tepco, helped install covers on two damaged reactor buildings between October 2012 and December 2013. He was diagnosed with leukaemia while still in his 30s. A health ministry official said the man had worn protective gear while at the plant and would be awarded compensation to cover medical costs and lost income. “While the causal link between his exposure to radiation and his illness is unclear, we certified him from the standpoint of worker compensation,” the official said. Three other plant workers suffering from cancer are awaiting confirmation that their illnesses are linked to the accident, which sent large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 residents, most of whom are still unable to return to their homes.

Photograph: Sergey Ponomarev/AP Tepco said it could not comment on the decision to approve the worker’s compensation claim. “We would like to offer our condolences to the worker,” a Tepco spokesman said. “We will continue to reduce the radiation dose of the working environment and manage thoroughly workers’ exposure to radiation.” Before his diagnosis the man had been exposed to 16 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation at Fukushima and a further 4 mSv during three months he spent at another nuclear plant in 2012. Compensation insurance is awarded to workers after exposure to 5 mSv in a year, according to the ministry. According to Tepco, 21,000 of the 45,000 people who have worked at Fukushima since the disaster were exposed to more than 5 mSv of radiation between March 2011 and the end of July this year. More than 9,000 have received a dose of at least 20 mSv, and six have been exposed to more than 250 mSv. “A dose of 100 mSv per annum is very high, and 250 mSv would be unconscionable,” said Dr Ian Fairlie, an independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment. “Clearly what is happening at Fukushima Daiichi is that thousands of temporary workers are being exposed to high radiation levels, then dismissed when their dosimeters reach the limit.” Radioactive wreckage: inside Fukushima's nuclear exclusion zone – in pictures Read more The man’s exposure to relatively low amounts of radiation – lower, even, than those deemed safe enough for residents to return to their homes – could prompt a rethink of the government’s push to promote the resettlement of displaced Fukushima evacuees. Experts are divided on whether low doses of radiation, below a threshold of 100 mSv, can be linked to cancer. “This is a landmark decision from the viewpoint of workers’ rights, and it’s probably just the tip of the iceberg,” Shinzo Kimura, associate professor of radiation and hygiene at Dokkyo Medical University, told Agence France-Presse. He said the decision to recognise the man’s cancer as radiation-related, despite his relatively low dose, was “an alarm bell” for the government. Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College London, said she was surprised by the health ministry’s decision to recognise the diagnosis as linked to radiation exposure while working at Fukushima. “Given the low doses that the workers were exposed to, the increased risk is very small at these doses, and it would be very difficult to be certain that this was due to radiation and not to other factors that cause leukaemia,” Thomas said. “At these doses, the other factors are a more likely cause of the man’s illness.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A worker is screened for radiation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Photograph: Issei Kato/AFP/Getty Images Anti-nuclear campaigners said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Japanese authorities had been premature in saying there would be no discernible impact on health from the disaster. “This is a massive blow to the IAEA, which stated in September of this year that no discernible health effects due to the exposure to radiation released by the accident are to be expected,” Greenpeace Japan said. Jan Vande Putte, a radiation expert with Greenpeace Belgium, said: “The statement from the IAEA that there would be no discernible health effects from the Fukushima disaster was clearly premature. “The impacts both from the initial releases and from the ongoing nuclear crisis have yet to be fully seen, as the historical example of Chernobyl demonstrates. Greenpeace calls on the IAEA and the Japanese authorities to retract their unsubstantiated and unscientific statement. The workers on-site and the citizens of Fukushima are suffering from the consequences of this nuclear disaster. Denying this reality is both dismissive of their suffering and undermines their fight for justice for themselves and their families.” There has been a significant spike in the rate of thyroid cancer among children and young people living in Fukushima at the time of the accident, but local medical authorities claim the increase is owing to the use of sensitive equipment and the unusually large number of people being tested, and is not the result of radiation exposure. That claim was challenged recently by Toshihide Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University, whose study found that cases of thyroid cancer among Fukushima children are 20 to 50 times higher than among children elsewhere in Japan.",5893823fee4241e27bfb55dd
2017-02-02T07:05:37Z,theguardian.com,2013-11-20,environment,"Fukushima nuclear disaster is warning to the world, says power company boss",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/19/uk-government-new-plant-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-warning,"The catastrophic triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011 was ""a warning to the world"" about the hazards of nuclear power and contained lessons for the British government as it plans a new generation of nuclear power stations, the man with overall responsibility for the operation in Japan has told the Guardian. Speaking at his Tokyo corporate headquarters , Naomi Hirose, president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the stricken Fukushima plant, said Britain's nuclear managers ""should be prepared for the worst"" in order to avoid repeating Japan's traumatic experience. ""We tried to persuade people that nuclear power is 100% safe. That was easy for both sides. Our side explains how safe nuclear power is. The other side is the people who listen and for them it is easy to hear OK, it's safe, sure, why not? ""But we have to explain, no matter how small a possibility, what if this [safety] barrier is broken? We have to prepare a plan if something happens … It is easy to say this is almost perfect so we don't have to worry about it. But we have to keep thinking: what if …"" British ministers recently agreed a commercial deal with the French state-owned energy company EDF Energy to build the UK's first new nuclear reactor in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The agreement included the UK government providing accident insurance. Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi facility on the coast about 124 miles (200km) north-east of Tokyo, comprising six nuclear reactors, was hit by a giant tsunami with waves peaking at 17 metres high caused by the Great East Japan earthquake on 11 March 2011. In what quickly became one of the world's worst nuclear disasters, operators lost control of the plant when the power supply, including emergency back-up, failed amid massive flooding. As cooling systems malfunctioned, reactors 1, 2 and 3 suffered meltdowns. Reactor 4 was closed for routine maintenance at the time. But one of several hydrogen explosions blew the walls and roof off the reactor building. This week a delicate and lengthy operation to remove fuel rods from that reactor began. Radiation leakage following the explosions forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding area. An exclusion zone roughly 11 miles by 19 miles remains in force around the plant two and half years later. The entire facility is now being decommissioned, but Tepco's clean-up, which has been strongly criticised by environmentalists, is expected to take up to 40 years. Hirose said that although the situation facing Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March was exceptional, measures could have been adopted in advance that might have mitigated the impact of the disaster. Tepco was at fault for failing to take these steps, he said. ""After I became president [in 2012], we formed a nuclear safety review committee. We focused mainly on what we could do, what we could learn. We had a lot of data by then. Three other reports, one from the Diet [Japan's parliament], one from government. We had a lot of information. Tepco's own report, too. We concluded that we should have avoided that catastrophic accident, and we could have. We could see what we should have done."" Preventative measures included fitting waterproof seals on all the doors in the reactor building, or placing an electricity-generating turbine on the facility's roof, where the water might not have reached it. In addition, wrong assumptions were made, he said. ""I don't know if I could have seen or thought this before the accident … Probably I assumed that people had discussed counter-measures to avoid a huge tsunami by something very special like a complete shutdown."" It transpired that the huge cost and technical complexity of a multiple shutdown, in what was considered the unlikely event of an abnormally large tsunami, had led managers to discount such a scenario as implausible and inefficient, he said. ""What happened at Fukushima was, yes, a warning to the world,"" he said. The resulting lesson was clear: ""Try to examine all the possibilities, no matter how small they are, and don't think any single counter-measure is foolproof. Think about all different kinds of small counter-measures, not just one big solution. There's not one single answer. ""We made a lot of excuses to ourselves … Looking back, seals on the doors, one little thing, could have saved everything."" Tepco was willing to share its experience with British and other nuclear plant operators if they wished, Hirose said. ""We can share all the information, all the data we obtained, that we learned from this accident, and then hope that people will use the data and information to prevent the same thing happening."" Hirose confirmed that his company has paid a large price for the disaster. It planned to ""streamline"" the business and shed hundreds of jobs through voluntary retirement to keep itself in business. ""We have a huge debt for the compensation for damages and losses and for decommissioning … We have to be sustainable as a going concern."" Concerned that Tepco may be unable to cope and responding to criticism that the company has bungled parts of the clean-up operation, Japan's government has agreed to spend 47bn yen (£292m) on dealing with hundreds of static tanks to store radiated water at the plant. It is also considering paying part of the cost to decommission Fukushima's damaged nuclear reactors. Tepco will reportedly seek 500bn yen (£3.1bn) in bank loans by the end of the year to help keep itself afloat. Asked about the severe domestic and international criticism that followed the discovery in July of leaks from some of the tanks storing contaminated water, Hirose said the problem stemmed from a ""simple mistake"" in managing the tanks. Since the discovery, the monitoring system had been changed and new welded tanks installed, instead of the old bolted together versions. Hirose said he could not state categorically that all leakage of contaminated groundwater into the sea had ceased, but the outflow was much reduced. ""Probably there is some leakage. It is very difficult to say where it comes from and how much it is, but the harbour [radioactivity] level does not go down, so that means there is some leakage … We are trying to stop it."" Hirose said he felt deeply sorry for the estimated 150,000 local residents who have been forced to leave their homes due to potentially harmful radiation levels, and may in some cases never be able to return. ""I have visited Fukushima many times, met the evacuees, the fishing union, the farmers, many people whose businesses have been damaged very much. I feel very sorry for them. We have to compensate them fully for the damage we caused by our accident."" Tepco was investing in the area and creating jobs by building a new thermal power plant. But he acknowledged reconstruction and rebuilding would take many years. After the Fukushima catastrophe, the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation conducted a safety review and its chief inspector, Mike Weightman, concluded there were ""no fundamental safety weaknesses"" in UK nuclear plants. He said: ""We already require protection of nuclear sites against the worst-case scenarios that are predictable for the UK."" But his report found 38 areas for improvement including risks associated with flooding and the state of preparedness for emergencies. In 2012, documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. EDF Energy said it was confident its UK sites were adequately protected against storms and floods. ""Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,"" said an EDF spokeswoman. Hirose said that although there are currently no nuclear powerplants operating in Japan, nuclear power had a future in the country. Popular former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi called last week for Japan to abandon nuclear power altogether, saying it was demonstrably dangerous. The best course for Japan and other developed countries was energy diversification, Hirose said, combining nuclear power with other forms of generation, including oil, gas and renewables.

The disaster is thought to have caused thousands of cancer cases. It was the only event classed as a “major accident” by the International Atomic Energy Agency until the 2011 meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. The data demonstrates its impact: in the 32 years before Chernobyl, 409 reactors were opened, but only 194 have been connected in the three decades since. Nuclear reactors connected since 1986 Chernobyl disaster Number of nuclear reactors connected since 1986 Chernobyl disaster. There were other factors in play, too.

The disaster in Japan prompted the German government to phase out its plants, with the last one closing in 2022. “Nuclear energy is failing because it is simply too expensive,” says Dr Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. “If there’s another nuclear accident in the next five or 10 years, you can say goodbye to the industry.”",589387ccee4241e1a78a5ac3
2017-02-02T07:56:48Z,theguardian.com,2013-05-20,environment,"Climate change: human disaster looms, claims new research",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/may/19/climate-change-meltdown-unlikely-research,"Some of the most extreme predictions of global warming are unlikely to materialise, new scientific research has suggested, but the world is still likely to be in for a temperature rise of double that regarded as safe. The researchers said warming was most likely to reach about 4C above pre-industrial levels if the past decade's readings were taken into account. That would still lead to catastrophe across large swaths of the Earth, causing droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves, and drastic effects on agricultural productivity leading to secondary effects such as mass migration. Some climate change sceptics have suggested that because the highest global average temperature yet recorded was in 1998 climate change has stalled. The new study, which is published in the journal Nature Geoscience, shows a much longer ""pause"" would be needed to suggest that the world was not warming rapidly. Alexander Otto, at the University of Oxford, lead author of the research, told the Guardian that there was much that climate scientists could still not fully factor into their models. He said most of the recent warming had been absorbed by the oceans but this would change as the seas heat up. The thermal expansion of the oceans is one of the main factors behind current and projected sea level rises. The highest global average temperature ever recorded was in 1998, under the effects of a strong El Niño, a southern Pacific weather system associated with warmer and stormy weather, which oscillates with a milder system called La Niña. Since then the trend of average global surface temperatures has shown a clear rise above the long-term averages – the 10 warmest years on record have been since 1998 – but climate sceptics have claimed that this represents a pause in warming. Otto said that this most recent pattern could not be taken as evidence that climate change has stopped. ""Given the noise in the climate and temperature system, you would need to see a much longer period of any pause in order to draw the conclusion that global warming was not occurring,"" he said. Such a period could be as long as 40 years of the climate record, he said. Otto said the study found that most of the climate change models used by scientists were ""pretty accurate"". A comprehensive global study of climate change science is expected to be published in September by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, its first major report since 2007. Jochem Marotzke, professor at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and a co-author of the paper, said: ""It is important not to over-interpret a single decade, given what we know, and don't know, about natural climate variability. Over the past decade the world as a whole has continued to warm but the warming is mostly in the subsurface oceans rather than at the surface."" Other researchers also warned that there was little comfort to be taken from the new estimates – greenhouse gas emissions are rising at a far higher rate than had been predicted by this stage of the 21st century and set to rise even further, so estimates for how much warming is likely will also have to be upped. Richard Allan, reader in climate at the University of Reading, said: ""This work has used observations to estimate Earth's current heating rate and demonstrate that simulations of climate change far in the future seem to be pretty accurate. However, the research also indicates that a minority of simulations may be responding more rapidly towards this overall warming than the observations indicate."" He said the effect of pollutants in the atmosphere, which reflect the sun's heat back into space, was particularly hard to measure. He noted the inferred sensitivity of climate to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations based on this new study, suggesting a rise of 1.2C to 3.9C, was consistent with the range from climate simulations of 2.2C to 4.7C. He said: ""With work like this our predictions become ever better.""",58938f00ee4241e3a088ae3a

Rivers and streams crossed earlier by balancing across stepping stones with trekking poles or splashing through a ford in a car become real test pieces on the return trip. Push your luck on beck crossings at your peril, as mountain rescue statistics show. Full marks then to drivers who resist the temptation of attacking a flooded ford, as those who do often come to grief. Little Langdale ford across the river Brathay is a case in point. There is even a warning sign in a nearby climbing hut: ""Do not try to use the ford from Little Langdale with vehicles"". Roper ford across the river Winster near Bowness-on-Windermere is another example. Staff at the nearby Brown Horse Inn try to dissuade customers intent on trying this crossing after heavy rain; the way across is not obvious. Even diminutive Carrock Splash, above Hesket Newmarket, can turn into a nut-brown torrent. Walkers should beware submerged stepping stones, like those across the river Rothay by the house owned by the Wordsworth family from 1881 to 1935. When awash or icy, these slippery slabs under Loughrigg can be lethal. Fickle Steps in Wallowbarrow Gorge live up to their name as the river Duddon rises, despite a wire cable offering help. Pre-1974 this would have been a crossing from Cumberland into Lancashire but nowadays the river has been demoted to a parish boundary between Ulpha and Dunnerdale-with-Seathwaite. Beware, too, remote crossings over large, uneven stones such as those in Mosedale beck under Swindale crag and near Sleddale Hall (where Withnail and I was filmed).

Donald Trump has nominated Pruitt to lead an agency he has sued multiple times in his role as attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt has vowed to dismantle serried environmental rules and is currently involved in a legal effort by 27 states to overturn Barack Obama’s clean power plan, the president’s centerpiece policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Donald Trump picks climate change sceptic Scott Pruitt to lead EPA Read more “The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses,” Pruitt said in a statement. Trump said Pruitt is a “highly respected attorney general” who will reverse the EPA’s “out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs”. Earlier this year, the president-elect said there would be just “little tidbits left” of the EPA if he made it to the White House. Environmental groups have reacted with dismay at the nomination of Pruitt, warning that he will not only tear up much of Obama’s climate legacy but also imperil the reliably clean air and water that Americans have largely enjoyed over the past 40 years. Democrats have vowed to fight Pruitt’s nomination, with Chuck Schumer, the minority Senate leader, promising a torrid confirmation hearing for the Republican lawyer. Some Democrats are hopeful that a number of Republicans could join them to block Pruitt’s confirmation. “This is full-fledged environmental emergency, this is someone (Pruitt) who is a professional climate change denier,” said Brian Schatz, a senator from Hawaii. “This is a litmus test for every member of the Senate who believes in science. We are going to do everything to oppose his nomination, and we are confident we can do so.” Other elected Democrats have also vowed to take on Pruitt, with Eric Schneiderman, attorney general of New York, promising to “use the full power of my office” to compel the EPA to uphold federal environment laws. Republicans, the majority party in the Senate, have largely welcomed Trump’s pick. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma senator and a vocal denier of climate science, said Pruitt is “thoughtful, experienced and a natural pick” for the EPA administrator role. Inhofe is chairman of the Senate environment committee, which will question Pruitt prior to his confirmation. EPA staff have expressed nervousness over Pruitt’s nomination, given his zealous pursuit of the agency. Pruitt has fought against EPA regulations that prevent air pollution haze in national parks, methane leaks from drilling and mercury and arsenic seeping from power plants. Scott Pruitt's EPA: a dream for oil and gas groups but a nightmare for scientists Read more The attorney general has proved to be such a staunch advocate for fossil fuels that he allowed Oklahoma firm Devon Energy to use his letterhead to send a three-page complaint to the EPA in 2014. He has questioned the accepted scientific stance on climate change, claiming in May that the “debate is far from settled. Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.” One EPA scientist, who asked not to be named, said that Pruitt risks being an “unprecedented disaster” for the natural world and public health. Other EPA advisers warned that the agency risks being trampled under Trump’s agenda of boosting corporations and eviscerating climate action. “Pruitt doesn’t believe in the mission of the EPA, which is to protect human health and the environment,” said Lisa Garcia, vice-president of Earthjustice and a senior adviser to the last two EPA administrators. “This isn’t a business agency, it’s an environmental agency. It’s scary to have someone who doesn’t believe in the mission of the EPA walking in to run it. I expect they will choke the funding of the EPA and stop enforcing laws. The work of the agency will basically come to a halt. “People at the EPA are in shock, they are worried about carrying out its mission. People are worried about how they will do their jobs, even people who voted for Trump. They didn’t expect this. Clean air and water, safe places for our children to play – these things should be bipartisan. They should be above politics.” Trump has previously called climate change a “hoax” and threatened to end all spending on climate change and clean energy, but environmentalists saw a glimmer of hope when the real estate magnate met with Al Gore, the former vice-president, and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. Both regularly call for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The nomination of Pruitt, however, presages a lengthy battle between the Trump administration and green groups. “Donald Trump has made it clear that he intends to wage war on clean air and clean water,” said Benjamin Schreiber, climate and energy program director at Friends of the Earth US. “Trump has also put our climate in peril and shown he is out of step with the American people. With this EPA pick, Donald Trump is putting all Americans at risk.”",5893b8afee424130c2f53e15
2017-02-02T11:04:39Z,theguardian.com,2012-11-29,environment,BP suspended from new US federal contracts over Deepwater disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/epa-suspends-bp-oil-spill,"BP has been blocked from seeking new contracts with the US government because of the oil company's ""lack of business integrity"" during the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday. The temporary order bans BP from competing for new oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico – such as the auction of 20m acres taking place on Wednesday – or from bidding on new contracts to supply the Pentagon or other government agencies with fuel. While the ban does not affect existing business, it raises wider questions about the company's future in a crucial market. The type of suspension imposed by the EPA typically does not last more than 18 months. But an official said that in this case the ban could be extended because of the ongoing legal proceedings. That could mean BP, the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico, would remain under an extended moratorium until all criminal charges and law suits are resolved. BP was clearly taken by surprise and struggled to explain the impact on its business. Its shares fell nearly 2% in London as investors reacted with dismay to the news which puts a major dent in the company's already battered reputation. The finance director of the London-based oil group warned investors at a recent presentation that any outright ban could ""affect BP's investment thesis in the US"".  The order was handed down just two weeks after BP agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter and other charges arising from the April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, as well as pay a record $4.5bn in fines. The oil company, in announcing its plea deal with the Justice Department earlier this month, had specifically said it did not expect to be barred from future business dealings. ""Under US law, companies convicted of certain criminal acts can be debarred from contracting with the federal government,"" the company said in its statement at the time. ""BP has not been advised of the intention of any federal agency to suspend or debar the company in connection with this plea agreement."" The EPA said the suspension was based on BP's conduct at the time of the blow-out as well as the 87 days it took to contain the well. Some 4.9m barrels of crude gushed into the Gulf of Mexico before it was finally capped. ""EPA is taking this action due to BP's lack of business integrity as demonstrated by the company's conduct with regard to the Deepwater Horizon blowout, explosion, oil spill, and response, as reflected by the filing of a criminal information,"" the announcement said. The announcement went on to describe the oil spill as the ""largest environmental disaster in US history"". It said BP would remain under suspension, and barred from new federal government contracts and transactions, until the company can demonstrate that it meets federal business standards. ""Federal executive branch agencies take these actions to ensure the integrity of federal programmes by conducting business only with responsible individuals or companies. Suspensions are a standard practice when a responsibility question is raised by action in a criminal case,"" the EPA announcement said. The agency gave no further details about the duration of the suspension, and the potential costs to BP were not immediately clear. In its response, BP said the ban would not affect existing business. ""The temporary suspension does not affect any existing contracts the company has with the US government, including those related to current and ongoing drilling and production operations in the Gulf of Mexico,"" BP said. The company said it was working with EPA and the US Justice Department to lift the suspension. ""The EPA has informed BP that it is preparing a proposed administrative agreement that, if agreed upon, would effectively resolve and lift this temporary suspension. The EPA notified BP that such a draft agreement would be available soon,"" the statement said. The press release also noted that BP had been granted more than 50 new leases in the Gulf of Mexico since the oil disaster. Peter Hutton, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said the EPA action had ""real significance"", especially as it came days after Lamar McKay, the head of BP in America, was promoted to head of global exploration and production.  ""The critical question is whether this is a shot across BP's bows to get a settlement, or a more sustained stance, in which case the importance of the context is underlined by comments from BP's chief financial officer, Brian Gilvary, in a recent conference call that such actions could 'affect BP's investment thesis in US'."" But Joe Lampel, professor of strategy at the Cass Business School in London, said while the ban was a blow to BP the damage should be relatively limited. ""This suspension should be seen as an additional penalty rather than a pressure tactic that the US government often uses when it wants to force firms to concede liability. We do not know how long the ban will last, but I suspect that it will be lifted after a sufficient grace period has passed."" In its attempt to consign Deepwater to the past, BP has agreed to pay $7.8bn to settle private claims stemming from the spill, and with the plea deal reached earlier this month, had hoped to limit its criminal liability. It is still on the hook for up to $21bn for environmental damage to the Gulf. Wednesday's move by the EPA presents an additional complication. Meanwhile, two BP rig supervisors appeared in a New Orleans court on Wednesday to be formally charged with manslaughter in the deaths of 11 workers aboard the rig. The supervisors, Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza, are accused of ignoring abnormal pressure readings seen as a red flag of a well blow-out. Kaluza told reporters just before his hearing that he was innocent of the charges. ""I think about the tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon every day. But I did not cause the tragedy,"" he told reporters at the court. ""I am innocent and I put my trust, reputation and future in the hands of the judge and jury."" A former BP executive David Rainey was charged separately for allegedly lying to Congress about the amount of oil that was gushing from the well. All three men were expected to plead not guilty. The EPA action was positively received by a number of key players, including former senator Bob Graham, who had chaired the White House oil spill commission. ""I can't put a dollar figure on what that would mean but I would assume that access to one of the larger reserves of petroleum in the world – which the Gulf of Mexico is – would have some economic consequences. And the longer the prohibition, the greater the consequences,"" Graham told the Guardian. He went on to praise the Obama administration for holding the oil company to account. ""I think sending a very strong signal that the federal government is going to be a much better steward of public property and that those who are permitted to explore and then potentially exploit those public properties are going to have to conduct themselves by world-class standards,"" Graham said. Campaign groups also applauded the move by the EPA. But the Oceana conservation group said the tough line from the Obama administration was undercut by its decision to go ahead with new lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday. ""We are pleased that BP is being penalised for the irresponsible actions,"" said Matt Dundas, the campaign director. But he went on: ""Overall, President Obama is missing the lesson of the Deepwater Horizon disaster which is that offshore drilling is inherently dirty and dangerous and needs to be phased out.""",5893bb07ee424132f8fd3923
2017-02-02T11:08:33Z,theguardian.com,2012-11-16,environment,BP to pay $4.5bn penalty over Deepwater Horizon disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/15/bp-deepwater-horizon-gulf-oil-spill,"BP met its day of reckoning in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster on Thursday when the company admitted guilt on 14 criminal charges and agreed to pay an historic $4.5bn (£2.8bn) penalty in connection with the fatal explosion of its rig and the catastrophic oil spill. The payments include $4bn for criminal charges and $525m to security regulators. BP will plead guilty to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect in relation to the deaths of 11 men aboard the Deepwater Horizon when the rig blew up and sank in April 2010, as well as misdemeanour counts under the clean water and migratory bird acts. The company will plead guilty to lying to Congress. ""This marks the single largest criminal fine – $1.25bn – and the single largest total criminal resolution – $4bn – in the history of the United States,"" the attorney general, Eric Holder, told a news conference in New Orleans. ""I hope this sends a clear message to those who would engage in this kind of reckless and wanton misconduct that there will be a significant penalty to be paid."" Three BP officials were also charged, in addition to the charges against the company. Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza, the two senior managers aboard the Deepwater Horizon, face charges of manslaughter and of negligence in supervising the pressure tests on the well. ""In the face of glaring red flags indicating that the well was not secure, both men allegedly failed to take appropriate action to prevent the blowout,"" said assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer. David Rainey, BP's former vice-president for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, was charged with obstruction of Congress and lying about how much oil was gushing from the well. The criminal settlement does not settle all of the claims against BP for the April 2010 blowout of the Deepwater Horizon and the subsequent oil spill. BP is still on the hook for environmental damage to the Gulf of Mexico and could face up to $21bn in penalties under the clean water act for restoration costs to waters, coastline and marine life. Holder said the federal government would ""vigorously"" pursue the case. But Thursday's deal does free the company to focus on resolving those other civil claims and on ongoing operations. BP said it not had been advised on any ban on future operations: the company was awarded a new oil lease in the Gulf of Mexico last year. The company said it had agreed to appoint two safety monitors to help improve safety. Its chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, said BP believed the settlement was in the company's best interests. ""We believe this resolution is in the best interest of BP and its shareholders,"" he said. ""It removes two significant legal risks and allows us to vigorously defend the company against the remaining civil claims."" In London, the company's shares, which had stopped trading before the news of the fine broke, closed down a fraction of a penny at 425.4p. So far, the company has set aside $38.1bn to settle claims and fines related to the disaster. Reaction from environmental groups was mixed. Greenpeace said the fine amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist for BP. ""This fine amounts to a rounding error for a corporation the size of BP,"" the environmental group said. The Oceana conservation group said it was pleased the US government was holding BP accountable for its negligence in the spill, but added: ""By rights, this settlement should be just a first step."" It said the real test of the government's will would come when it came to assessing civil penalties on BP for environmental damage. Ed Markey, the senior Democrat on the house natural resources committee, said the fines were appropriate: ""People died, BP lied to Congress, and millions of barrels of oil poured into the Gulf. This steep cost to BP will provide the Gulf coast some of the funds needed to restore the region, and will hopefully deliver some comfort and closure to the families and businesses affected by the spill."" Under the deal, the oil company will pay about $1.25bn in fines along with payments of nearly $2.4bn to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and $350m to the National Academy of Sciences. Holder said much of that money would be spent in the Gulf and in developing better oil clean-up technology. The company will pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $350m for misleading investors by deliberately under-estimating the amount of crude gushing from the well. The settlement remains subject to US federal court approval. It also remains separate from the Justice Department's investigation of BP's partners in the well, Transocean, which owned the rig, and Halliburton, which cemented the well. • This article was amended on 16 November 2012. The original misquoted attorney general Eric Holder as saying the penalties were the largest criminal fines in history at $1.25m and $4m. He said $1.25bn and $4bn.",5893bbf1ee424132f8fd3ce1
2017-02-02T11:16:55Z,theguardian.com,2012-10-16,environment,"Fukushima disaster could have been avoided, nuclear plant operator admits",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/fukushima-disaster-avoided-nuclear-plant,"The company at the centre of Japan's worst nuclear crisis has acknowledged for the first time that it could have avoided the disaster that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi power plant last year. In a reversal of its insistence that nothing could have protected the plant against the earthquake and tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people on 11 March, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had known safety improvements were needed before the disaster, but had failed to implement them. ""When looking back on the accident, the problem was that preparations were not made in advance,"" Tepco's internal reform taskforce, led by the firm's president, Naomi Hirose, said in a statement on Monday. The company could have taken steps to prevent a catastrophic accident by adopting more extensive safety measures, the statement added. Tepco's about-turn came after an independent panel of experts challenged its claim that it could not have foreseen the up to 14m high waves that swept through the plant, knocking out its backup power supply and causing three of its six reactors to melt down. In a damning report released in July, a parliament-appointed panel criticised years of ""collusion"" between Tepco, industry regulators and politicians, and described the disaster as ""manmade"". The crisis forced the evacuation of 150,000 residents, most of whom have yet to return home, and led Japan to announce it would end its reliance on nuclear energy, although it has since dropped its deadline to phase out atomic power by 2040. In a rare moment of introspection, an internal taskforce set up to reform the embattled utility said the firm feared that improvements in safety would highlight the risks to nuclear power plants and encourage the anti-nuclear lobby. ""There was a worry that if the company were to implement a severe-accident response plan, it would spur anxiety throughout the country and in the communities near where nuclear plants are sited, and lend momentum to the anti-nuclear movement,"" the report said. The firm conceded that some suggested safety improvements, such as using multiple power sources and cooling systems, would have required the plant's temporary closure and added to its costs. Acknowledging that previous safety measures were insufficient could have invited lawsuits, it added. The statement said the company should have adhered more closely to international safety standards for atomic facilities, and trained specialist staff in practical disaster response rather than relying on safety drills it dismissed as a ""formality"". Tepco's admission that it was unprepared for the disaster came after the first meeting of an independent advisory committee set up to help the company reform its nuclear operations. ""It is very clear that mistakes were made,"" Dale Klein, the former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and head of the reform committee, told reporters in Tokyo. ""It is very important for Tepco to recognise the need to reform, and the committee is very anxious to facilitate the reform necessary for Tepco to become a world-class company. ""The committee's goal is to ensure that Tepco develops practices and procedures so an accident like this will never happen again."" Klein said individual workers at the plant would be expected to challenge the pervading culture of complacency over safety. ""The challenge that Tepco will have is establishing a culture so that every individual understands they are responsible for safety,"" he said. The report noted that Tepco had not made any safety improvements to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since 2002, and had dismissed the possibility of it being hit by a massive tsunami, even though it could not produce supporting data. It had, for example, insisted that Fukushima Daiichi's 5.7m seawall was high enough to withstand a tsunami generated by a large quake in the area, despite a warning in 2008 by its own engineers that much bigger waves were possible. Tepco repeated claims it had done everything possible to prevent a disaster as recently as July. Instead, it accused the prime minister at the time of the accident, Naoto Kan, of exacerbating the problem by interfering in the firm's response. Tepco has been forced to reform its management and operations after the government saved it from collapse in May, in effect nationalising it with a 1tn-yen bailout. Despite Japan's plan to phase out nuclear power, Tepco's 10-year business plan includes the need to restart idled reactors, beginning with those at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in northern Japan. But the company denied its admission of culpability and efforts at reform were intended to mollify the public ahead of a quick return to nuclear power generation. ""The reforms are intended to improve our safety culture, and we have no intention to link it to the possibility of resuming the [Kashiwazaki-Kariwa] plant,"" Takafumi Anegawa, a Tepco official, told the Associated Press. ""We don't have any preconditions for our reforms."" The firm's efforts to restart other reactors received a boost from Barbara Judge, the former chair of the UK atomic energy authority, who said nuclear plants could operate safely – even in quake-prone countries such as Japan – provided the right safety measures were in place. ""It's a question of determination of the risks. It's a question of making sure that there is a plan for how to deal with the risks, or the problem, should they eventuate,"" Judge said.",5893bde7ee424132f8fd4515
2017-02-02T11:22:54Z,theguardian.com,2009-12-11,environment,"Ocean acidification rates pose disaster for marine life, major study shows",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/10/ocean-acidification-epoca,"The world's oceans are becoming acidic at a faster rate than at any time in the last 55m years, threatening disaster for marine life and food supplies across the globe, delegates at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen have been warned. A report by more than 100 of Europe's leading marine scientists, released at the climate talks this morning, states that the seas are absorbing dangerous levels of carbon dioxide as a direct result of human activity. This is already affecting marine species, for example by interfering with whale navigation and depleting planktonic species at the base of the food chain. Ocean acidification – the facts says that acidity in the seas has increased 30% since the start of the industrial revolution. Many of the effects of this acidification are already irreversible and are expected to accelerate, according to the scientists. The study, which is a massive review of existing scientific studies, warns that if CO2 emissions continue unchecked many key parts of the marine environment – particularly coral reefs and the algae and plankton which are essential for fish such as herring and salmon – will be ""severely affected"" by 2050, leading to the extinction of some species. Dr Helen Phillips, chief executive of Natural England, which co-sponsored the report, said: ""The threat to the delicate balance of the marine environment cannot be overstated - this is a conservation challenge of unprecedented scale and highlights the urgent need for effective marine management and protection."" Although oceans have acidified naturally in the past, the current rate of acidification is so fast that it is becoming extremely difficult for species and habitats to adapt. ""We're counting it in decades, and that's the real take-home message,"" said Dr John Baxter a senior scientist with Scottish Natural Heritage, and the report's co-author. ""This is happening fast."" The report, published by the EU-funded European Project on Ocean Acidification, a consortium of 27 research institutes and environment agencies, states that the survival of a number of marine species is affected or threatened, in ways not recognised and understood until now. These species include: • whales and dolphins, who will find it harder to navigate and communicate as the seas become ""noisier"". Sound travels further as acidity increases. Noise from drilling, naval sonar and boat engines is already travelling up to 10% further under water and could travel up to 70% further by 2050. • brittle stars (Ophiothrix fragilis) produce fewer larvae because they need to expend more energy maintaining their skeletons in more acid seas. These larvae are a key food source for herring. • tiny algae such as Calcidiscus leptoporus which form the basis of the marine food chain for fish such as salmon may be unable to survive. • young clownfish will lose their ability to ""smell"" the anemone species that they shelter in. Experiments show that acidification interferes with the species' ability to detect the chemicals that give ""olfactory cues"". The report predicts that the north Atlantic, north Pacific and Arctic seas – a crucial summer feeding ground for whales - will see the greatest degree of acidification. It says that levels of aragonite, the type of calcium carbonate which is essential for marine organisms to make their skeletons and shells, will fall worldwide. But because cold water absorbs CO2 more quickly, the study predicts that levels of aragonite will fall by 60% to 80% by 2095 across the northern hemisphere. ""The bottom line is the only way to slow this down or reverse it is aggressive and immediate cuts in CO2,"" said Baxter. ""This is a very dangerous global experiment we're undertaking here."" Written for policy makers and political leaders, the document is being distributed worldwide, with 32,000 copies printed in five major languages including English, Chinese and Arabic. Every member of the US congress, now struggling to agree a binding policy on CO2 emissions, will be sent a copy. Congressman Brian Baird, a Democrat representative from Washington state, who championed a bill in Congress promoting US research on ocean acidification, said these findings would help counter climate change sceptics, since acidification was easily and immediately measurable. ""The consequences of ocean acidification may be every bit as grave as the consequences of temperature increases,"" he said. ""It's one thing to question a computer extrapolation, or say it snowed in Las Vegas last year, but to say basic chemistry doesn't apply is a real problem [for the sceptics]. I think the evidence is really quite striking.""",5893bf4eee42414f8b464c79
2017-02-02T11:24:33Z,theguardian.com,2009-12-04,environment,From the archive: Indian gas disaster leaves 410 dead,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/04/bhopal-indian-gas-disaster-410-dead,"At least 410 people were killed and thousands admitted to hospitals yesterday after poisonous gas escaped from a pesticides factor in the central Indian town of Bhopal. Doctors expected the final toll to exceed 600. Witnesses said that a densely populated area of about 15 square miles was turned into ""one vast gas chamber"". The leakage from the Union Carbide Factory, owned by a US multi-national, began soon after midnight and was brought under control about one-and-a-half hours later. The gas, which escaped from an underground storage tank, was identified by the Indian managing director, Mr V.P. Gokhale, as methyl isocyanate. The Press Trust of India news agency quoted health officials as saying 335 deaths had been reported at Bhopal's three hospitals, and more victims were feared undiscovered in their homes. Many people, unconscious and frothing at the mouth, were still being brought to the hospital last night. Hundreds of dead dogs, cats, cows, buffaloes, and birds littered the streets. Police threw a cordon round Bhopal, stopping trains, planes and vehicles from entering the city. Hospitals treated hundreds of victims on lawns because of a shortage of beds. In Delhi, a government environmentalist, Mr T.N. Kushoo, said that the disaster appeared to be more severe than the explosion at a chemical plant at Seveso in Italy eight years ago. Six senior employees of Union Carbide were arrested for questioning last night as a national police team began to investigate the cause of the disaster. The Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Ghandi, allocated 10 million rupees for immediate relief. Thousands of inhabitants fled the stricken town. ""My neighbour ran in and said it was a nuclear bomb,"" Mrs Madhu Mishra, a teacher at Bbopal university, said. ""It was gruesome, a nightmare,"" she said. ""There were about 8,000 or 9,000 people on the road in the dead of night. There were cars, bicycles, auto-rickshaws, anything that could move on the road trying to get up the hill. I saw people just collapsing by the roadside."" The local health director, Dr N. Nago, said the gas attacked the lungs and bloodstream, causing suffocation. People up to six miles from the factory woke up coughing violently, choking and struggling for breath. They also suffered inflamed eyes and vomiting. The factory, built seven years ago, produces pesticides for agriculture. The regional manager, Mr S. Kumsaraswamy, said the disaster was caused by pressure that built up inside the tank and ruptured a valve.",5893bfb1ee42414f8b464e32
2017-02-02T11:29:55Z,theguardian.com,2005-11-12,"environment, naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment",Aid agency warns against planned UN disaster fund,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/nov/12/naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment,"Emergency responses to natural disasters, such as the Pacific tsunami or the earthquake in Kashmir, could be hampered by a UK-government backed plan, a leading British aid agency has warned. The proposals, which are supported by the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, are due to be voted on by the United Nations' general assembly next week and should increase the money available for humanitarian relief around the world. The UN's Central Emergency Revolving Fund (Cerf), to which $150m (£86m) has been pledged so far and to which the UK is the largest donor, is intended to provide a ready reserve of up to $1bn to fund rapid relief before cash from donors begins to arrive. The UK will contribute at least £40m ($70m). But the British charity Save the Children fears the new regime will only channel cash to UN agencies and make it more difficult for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to obtain backing, consequently delaying the delivery of aid. A succession of big natural disasters in the past year - including the tsunami, which claimed 275,000 lives, Hurricane Katrina, and the Kashmir earthquake, which has killed 87,000 people - has highlighted the need for faster relief and improved coordination of rescue efforts. ""There's a danger that Cerf is being touted as the solution to all problems,"" said Toby Porter, emergencies director of Save the Children UK. ""At the moment the proposal is that it's only going to make grants to UN agencies. They simply cannot move quickly enough. They are too unwieldy. Global assistance is being delivered more and more by NGOs. One would not want to make up a system where the only people to benefit from UN funding are UN agencies."" NGOs, he said, would be able to subcontract under the plan, but it would involve further delays. This summer a Red Cross disaster report severely criticised duplication of effort between NGOs, local governments and UN agencies after the tsunami. In a scathing section on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh, it found: ""A scramble for beneficiaries began ... Coordination became difficult. Out of 200 agencies present in late January, only 46 submitted reports to UN coordinators. At the root of coordination problems was one key factor: too much money. Nearly everyone could hire a helicopter or boat."" A spokesman for Oxfam said: ""We can have a debate about access once the fund it established. The key thing is that the world gets to respond more quickly."" A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ""Instead of having to have UN flash appeals every time there's a big disaster, we would have a standing fund. It will be a more flexible system. There will still be funds available from DfID for NGO projects.""",5893c0f3ee424152edfd163d

Conservationists, already dismayed by the death of millions of vultures in India, Nepal and Pakistan, caused by the birds consuming a cattle drug, have found other bird species are also susceptible. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is toxic to three species of Asian vulture - the oriental white-backed, long-billed and slender-billed. They die from kidney failure if they eat the carcasses of cattle treated with it. Conservationists estimate that 10-14 million birds have died; populations are still declining at 30% to 50% a year. ""It's probably the most significant conservation disaster ever in terms of the number of birds lost,"" said Jemima Parry-Jones at the US National Aviary in Pittsburgh. Dr Parry-Jones and the RSPB research team set out to discover whether diclofenac and related drugs are toxic to other birds. They asked zoo vets around the world for reports of unintentional bird deaths after treatment with the drugs. Of the 79 scavenging birds they received information on, the drugs were deadly for 30%, including the African white-backed vulture, saw-whet owl from North America, harris hawk, spoonbill, Eurasian gryphon vulture and African maribu stork. The researchers reported their results in the journal Biology Letters. The manufacture and import of diclofenac was banned in India in August, although it is not illegal to sell off stockpiles. It is banned in the US and Europe, but is still used in parts of Africa and South America.",5893c0f4ee424152183c3e18
2017-02-02T11:30:12Z,theguardian.com,2010-11-09,environment,"BP had little defence against a disaster, federal investigation says",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/08/bp-little-defence-deepwater-disaster,"The presidential commission investigating the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster ran into controversy today by saying it had found no evidence that BP and other oil companies put profits ahead of safety on the Deepwater Horizon rig. In a preliminary finding by what is the first independent panel, the commission's chief investigator found a series of missed warning signs before the April 20 explosion on the rig. Fred Bartlit said repeatedly that he had found no evidence to justify claims that BP and others on the Deepwater Horizon took shortcuts on safety to save money: ""To date, we have not found a single instance where human beings made a conscious decision to favour dollars over safety."" Bartlit, appointed by Barak Obama, had led the investigation into the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea, when 167 workers died. He was immediately accused by lawyers for Deepwater Horizon victims, environmentalists and Democrats in Congress of letting the oil company off the hook. But in an angry session with reporters he insisted he was not clearing BP, Transocean and Halliburton of responsibility for the disaster. ""Any time you are talking about $1.5m a day, money enters into it. All I am saying is that human beings did not sit there and sell human safety down the river for dollars that night,"" he said. Bartlit complained repeatedly during his presentation that he did not have subpoena powers and had to rely on the goodwill of oil firm.""I wish I had that power because I think it's damned important — but that's the way it goes,"" he said. The Senate refused to grant such powers. The commission's version of events, which agreed 90% with the conclusions of BP's internal investigations, runs counter to the narrative developed in congressional investigations that the firm regularly took safety short cuts to save money. ""When the culture of a company favours risk-taking and cutting corners above other concerns, systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or trade-offs being considered,"" Ed Markey, a Democratic congressman who led investigations into the spill, said in a statement. In a long and detailed re-enactment of events leading up to the explosion, Bartlit and his team outlined a clear trail where disaster could have been averted. The team also questioned executives from BP, Transocean and Halliburton. The investigation produced 13 findings on the path to the disaster. Eleven men died when the rig exploded, releasing nearly 5m barrels of oil and gas into the Gulf of Mexico. The Macondo well was from the start a challenging one. BP had intended to drill even deeper but stopped at 18,360ft because of the difficulties of preventing oil seeping into the surrounding rock. But despite those early difficulties BP, Transocean, and Halliburton overlooked warning signs several times during drilling. The investigation singled out the crew's decision to overlook the results of a negative pressure test on the well, hours before the 20 April explosion, which showed a faulty cement seal. ""The well was flowing. Hydrocarbons were leaking, but for whatever reason the crew after three hours … that night decided it was a good negative pressure test,"" said Sean Grimsley, Bartlit's associate. ""The question is, why these experienced men out on that rig talked themselves into believing that was a good test which established well integrity."" The failure is even more striking given BP and Halliburton knew by 20 April that the cement seal on the well was defective.""People knew there was one barrier. The well was under-balanced and that called for heightened high vigilance,"" Grimsley said. ""People knew you had to be really careful."" The findings included: • The cement seal at the bottom of the well failed to hold back oil and gas in the reservoir, and should have been redesigned. • BP and Transocean interpreted the failed negative pressure test as a success. • BP introduced additional safety risks in its plan to shut down the drilling rig. • Crews on the rig and in offshore offices should have picked up warnings on monitors that gas was rising from the well. • Rapid response at that time could have prevented a blowout. Many conclusions mirror those of BP's internal investigation, and Bartlit said he agreed with 90% of it. The most significant conclusions for BP could be the finding that the leak rose through the drill pipe rather than the space between the casing and the rock formation. That supports BP's contention that its well design was not a contributing factor in the explosion. Some analysts have said BP's choice of a ""long string"" well design – which was cheaper – increased the risk of oil and gas escaping the pipe. But Bartlit said he was inclined to agree with BP. Yesterday's session was the most dramatic of the five public hearings, as Bartlit strode across the floor, holding up pieces of drilling equipment. The commission is to produce its final report on 11 January. By its own admission, the commission's investigations are not exhaustive. He admitted at times he was unable to come to a conclusion when faced with different versions of events from BP, Transocean, Halliburton and the other oil companies involved.",5893c104ee42414e83d5fa22
2017-02-02T11:31:48Z,theguardian.com,2012-08-21,environment,Tiger population of India facing 'total disaster' due to tourism ban,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/20/tiger-population-india-tourism-ban,"It is not difficult to guess which animal the town of Sawai Madhopur has tethered its fortunes to. Fancy a drink? Pop into the Tiger bar at the Taj hotel. Want to rest your head? Try the Tiger Moon Resort. Want to shop? There are tiger-print pyjamas, aprons, tablecloths, bedspreads. Little in this Rajasthani town has not succumbed to tiger mania. Sitting cross-legged on a stage by the main road last Saturday, Yadvendra Singh handed over his business card, decorated, of course, with orange and black stripes. Since 1992 he has run Tiger Eye Adventure Tours, taking visitors from around the world on safari inside the nearby Ranthambore national park. But for the past three weeks, Singh has not been allowed in the park to check on the 27 adult tigers and 25 cubs who call it home. No one has, after India's supreme court issued an order banning tourism in all core tiger habitats. The decree was temporary, until 22 August, when the court meets again to assess whether tigers and tourists can co-exist in India. The decision will have ramifications not just for India's approximately 1,700 tigers, but for the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Indians whose livelihoods depend on the big cats. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Singh. ""I've spent 20 years, half my life, doing this. And suddenly I'm supposed to find a new job."" But Singh, and many environmentalists and conservationists, insist the real losers will be the creatures who have helped pay his bills for two decades. ""If the ban on tourism continues, it will be the end of the tiger in India,"" he said. ""We're the ones who put energy into tracking them. We deter poachers. Tourists are only allowed in the park for six hours every day, but we guides take it in turns to patrol the park from sunrise to sunset. Voluntarily."" Map: India's tiger reserves Belinda Wright, executive director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, based in New Delhi, said a tourist ban would be a ""total disaster"". Stressing she was pro-tiger rather than pro-tourist, she said: ""There is no way the forestry department alone can protect tigers from poachers and local encroachment on the land."" The Corbett Foundation, another wildlife protection charity in India, agrees. ""While in principle, we all agree that wildlife tourism in India needs to be controlled and strictly regulated, placing a complete ban on any kind of tourism activities in the core areas will certainly not help the wildlife of the tiger reserves,"" it said in a statement. Since the court's judgment on 24 July, Singh has not earned a penny. Along with dozens of other guides and drivers who feed their families by servicing the tiger tourists who flock to Ranthambore every year, he has been holding a roadside protest to remind the authorities how integral tigers are to the town. There are no reliable figures to show how many tourists visit Sawai Madhopur each year, but in 2011, 288,000 tickets were sold to enter the national park. Demand is much higher, say locals, but numbers are restricted so a maximum of 40 vehicles carrying a total of 520 tourists are in the park at any one time. The interim order has hit hard, said Goverdhan Singh Rathore, a doctor who runs a free hospital from the profit made from his guest house, Khem Villas. ""We've already had 10% of bookings for next season cancelled,"" he said, sitting in the courtyard of his house, which is decorated with orange and black striped tiles. ""Forty per cent of guests have asked us to let them know what happens on the 22nd. If the ban is extended, next season is over."" He would have to close the hotel, and the hospital, which treated 90,000 patients last year, he added. Ajay Dubey, a campaigner who filed the petition to the supreme court, said all he was doing was asking it to enforce the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act. He claims the act prohibits tourism in India's tiger breeding areas. ""By God's grace I just want respect of rule of law – nothing else,"" he said in an email. No one was enforcing the law, Dubey added, and with tragic results. He points to the central state of Madhya Pradesh (MP), which has six tiger reserves. ""There were 700 tigers in MP in the year 2000; now the number has come down to 257,"" said Dubey. ""It speaks volumes."" He added: ""Tiger conservation is being adversely affected by mindless tourism; the large number of vehicles loaded with people were traumatising the endangered species in the critical tiger habitat."" But Wright said Dubey was using unreliable figures. ""Until the 2008 census, the tiger population was calculated using a discredited, unscientific method which allowed states to dramatically overestimate,"" she said over the phone in Delhi. The law says tiger reserves should have a core area that only forestry officials enter, surrounded by buffer land that can be visited by tourist vehicles. In April, the court ordered 13 states with tiger parks to file their zoning plans. Only three complied, amid difficulties in creating the buffers related to land acquisition, compensation for relocated villagers and local politics. Angered by the states' poor response, on 24 July the supreme court made an interim order banning all tourism from the core zones until the states complied. They have until 22 August to do so, until which time interested parties, such as guides and state governments, can submit evidence arguing why they believe tourists should be allowed in core areas. In Ranthambore that means not just the 393 sq km national park but also just over 900 sq km of adjoining land. YK Sahu, divisional forest officer at Ranthambore, said he believed that the presence of believes tourists saved tigers rather than endangered them. ""Look at where our tigers live. Just 6% to 10% of the park is visited by tourists, and yet it is in those areas where tigers flourish."" Tourists also report illegal wood cutting, he said, and help deter poachers. ""If the Taj Mahal was not a tourist site, would it look as it does in its present form?"", he asked. ""All of the marble would have been stolen by now."" Rathore, whose father, Fateh, founded the non-governmental organisation Tiger Watch and who was one of India's most renowned tiger experts until his death last year, said there was ""not one scrap of evidence"" to prove tourists kill tigers, directly or indirectly, or hamper their breeding. In fact, he claims, ""the relationship between the presence of tourists and the number of tigers is not inversely proportional, but directly proportional."" In 2005-06, the park had 26 tigers. Despite increasing tourism, the population risen to 53. ""People make up their mind that tourism is bad for tigers without consulting science. They see a picture of a queue of jeeps filled with tourists with long lens cameras pointing at a tiger and they say, 'poor tiger'. But how do they know that the tiger is unhappy? Maybe the tiger is enjoying it. Ecology tells us that when a creature is upset, they stop breeding. Yet in Ranthambore the tiger population has increased with tourism."" The supreme court seems to want the tiger states to restrict tourism to the buffer zones. But the problem in Ranthambore, as well as other reserves, is that the only area it can designate as buffer is not somewhere tourists would want to visit – let alone tigers. There, the buffer is a wilderness with very little flora or fauna, littered with gravel mines. To reach the zone, tigers would have to travel 35 miles from the main park, and even cross main roads. There are also many people living in the buffer – 62 villages have been relocated there from the core area since the 1970s. Before tiger tourism came to the area, they made their living chopping down trees in the tiger reserve and, in some cases, poaching tigers to serve the lucrative Chinese medicine market. In Kanha national park, a tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh, tribal people this week held a protest against the tourism ban. ""You do what you can to earn a living, whether that means cutting down trees … or even hunting tigers,"" one man told NDTV. Back in Ranthambore, August is always a lean month because most of the park is closed anyway during the monsoon. But some tourists usually come to visit the three zones that normally remain open, and fears are widespread about the effect of a permanent ban on the community. ""It's not just the guides who will be affected,"" said Singh as he protested by the roadside. ""It's the mechanics who service the jeeps, the hawkers who sell T-shirts, the hoteliers, the women who make handicrafts."" ""If tourists are not allowed in the core tiger zone, our economy will collapse,"" said Satish Jain, who has been a guide in the park since 1997. ""Our economy is based on tourism. It has to be – a lot of people used to be employed in a cement factory, but that was closed because of the national park. There was a gas bottling plant, but that was shut down too. How do they expect us to earn a living?"" Tiger facts India is home to half the world's tiger population. According to the latest census released in March 2011 by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the current population is estimated at 1,706 – up from 1,411 in 2008, but a long way off the 45,000 which reportedly roamed India 100 years ago. In India, the tiger is found in 18 states, from the Himalayas in the north to Tamil Nadu in the south and across the north-east into Burma. They occupy a variety of habitats including tropical evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, thorn forests and grass jungles. A total of 923 tigers were killed by poachers between 1994 and 2010, according to the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). An undercover investigation by the WPSI and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) in 2005 revealed that the trade in tiger and leopard body parts in China continues to thrive.",5893c164ee424132f8fd5360
2017-02-02T11:32:43Z,theguardian.com,2010-10-29,environment,BP was warned about cement at gulf disaster well,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/28/bp-warned-about-unstable-macondo-well-cement,"BP had been told weeks before the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon caused the world's biggest accidental offshore oil spill that the cement slurry that would be used for the well was unstable, the US presidential commission investigating the disaster said tonight. Halliburton, the US company responsible for the cement that was supposed to seal the well and prevent the fatal blow-out, carried out two tests of the mixture in February. These indicated that the foam slurry was unstable. Data from one of the tests was emailed to BP on 8 March, the commission said last night. ""There is no indication that Halliburton highlighted to BP the significance of the foam stability data or that BP personnel raised any questions about it,"" the panel's lead investigator, Fred Bartlit, said in a letter delivered to the commissioners. These results appear to contradict public assurances made by Halliburton after the disaster on 20 April that it had tested the cement before pumping it into the Macondo well and that the tests had indicated that the cement would be stable. Shares in Halliburton initially fell 16% on the news. BP shares are also likely to fall tomorrowmorning when the London stock market opens. The panel had asked Chevron to test mixture similar to that used in the Macondo well in a laboratory to find out if it was stable. When the results suggested it was not, the panel demanded Halliburton provide the data from its tests. Two further tests were carried out by Halliburton in April. The results of the first, thought to have been reported internally at the company by 17 April, again showed the mixture was unstable. A second test was carried out which appeared to show the slurry would be stable, but the panel said it did not know if this data was available internally before the cement had begun to be pumped into the well. It said that BP only learnt of the results of this fourth, and only, positive test following the explosion. The letter concluded: ""Only one of the four tests that Halliburton ran on the various slurry designs for the final cement job at the Macondo well indicated that the slurry design would be stable."" It added that ""Halliburton may not have had—and BP did not have — the results of that test before the evening of 19 April, meaning that the cement job may have been pumped without any lab results indicating that the foam cement slurry would be stable;"" and that ""Halliburton and BP both had results in March showing that a very similar foam slurry design to the one actually pumped at the Macondo well would be unstable, but neither acted upon that data; and Halliburton (and perhaps BP) should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well."" The letter made it clear that the blow-out of the Macondo well, which resulted in the deaths of 11 workers, could not be blamed solely on the quality of the cement. ""Cementing wells is a complex endeavour and industry experts inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon even in the best of circumstances."" BP could not be reached for comment . Halliburton said it was reviewing the panel's findings. BP itself has identified the cement as one of the main causes of the accident. When BP published its internal report into the disaster, Tony Hayward, the then chief executive, said a ""bad cement job"" was partly to blame. BP and the other companies involved in the accident face a host of investigations in the US which are likely to drag on for many years. US president Barack Obama appointed the commission to investigate the accident. It is thought that evidence of any alleged wrongdoing could be passed to the Justice Department, which is already conducting its own criminal probe. The joint investigation board appointed by the US homeland security and interior departments is also expected to produce a final report in January 2011. Next week BP will report its third-quarter results, a week later than previously expected.",5893c19bee42414e83d5fc96

The indemnity even covers accidents and leaks that are the consortium's fault. A row has broken out in parliament over the government's decision to sign the deal after it was revealed that the former energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, appeared to have broken Treasury guidelines by failing to inform MPs properly with the result that no backbencher could object. The former minister - now the government's climate change envoy - rushed the deal through parliament just before the summer recess. There was no ministerial statement, no document detailing the proposals placed in the House of Commons library and no opportunity for MPs to raise questions. He used emergency procedures claiming that the consortium, made up of the American company URS Washington, French firm Areva and the UK company Amec, had threatened to walk away unless Britain waived its rights to charge companies the first £140m for the costs of any accident. The contract is worth £6.5bn over five years and could be renewed for a further 12 years. The minister said the deal had to be completed by the beginning of October before parliament reconvened. Wicks consulted only the chairs of two parliamentary committees, ignoring Treasury guidance that he should issue a statement to MPs and place the details in the House of Commons library. His arguments persuaded Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, who waived his right to object because of the short timescale. Peter Luff, chairman of the business and regulatory reform select committee, had left it to Leigh to respond. Both MPs were under the impression that other MPs could object because details of the deal had been placed in the House of Commons library. They were not put there until October 14, 75 days after the time any MP could raise questions. Now Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, who raised the failure properly to inform parliament with the speaker, is expected to be granted a debate on the matter. He said yesterday: ""This is an outrage. The taxpayer has now been left with an unlimited liability while the consortium will make hundreds of millions of pounds of profit on the deal."" A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ""There is only an extremely small possibility of the indemnity ever being used and so the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority assessed that the benefits of engaging the contractor would far outweigh the small risk that the indemnity may be called upon. Due to an oversight by the department there was a delay in sending this minute to the House library.""",5893c1ebee424150a7e40a58

Just 10 days on, the story is fading from our TV screens and being relegated to the inside pages of the newspapers, though some things are getting worse. Yesterday's good news, that a three-year old girl had been pulled unscathed from the rubble of her home, was the exception to an otherwise terrible picture, since victims rarely survive for more than seven days. The death toll, nearly 40,000, seems certain to rise further. Many international rescue teams have ended their searches. Helicopter flights - the only way of reaching remote villages cut off by landslides and buckled roads - have resumed after being grounded by rain. The bad weather compounded the misery of thousands of injured survivors, many with suppurating wounds, in the Neelum Valley of Pakistani Kashmir, one of the remoter parts of the 20,000 sq kilometre area affected by the 7.6 magnitude quake. And helicopters are still in desperately short supply. Of the 54 now in operation just 15 are foreign - from the US, Germany and Afghanistan. The hundreds of helicopters being routinely used by US forces in Iraq are a reminder of how resources are concentrated in the hands of the world's only superpower, and what missions they are made available for. There are not enough tents, tarpaulins or blankets, all vital for emergency shelter as the temperatures drop. Amazingly, 15% of the populated areas of the earthquake zone have yet to be even reached by rescuers. Every natural disaster brings its own specific problems, and the sheer logistical difficulties of delivering relief to this region cannot be exaggerated. The human cost is certainly far greater than that of Hurricane Katrina in the US - where, for all the globally-observed drama, the final death toll was just over 1,000. But general factors are at work too. The South Asian earthquake is the latest in a year of some of the worst disasters ever. Governments and the international community have failed to respond adequately. Lives have been lost as a result. The first problem, according to a new report by Oxfam, is selectivity. While governments responded generously to the Boxing Day tsunami, partly because so many tourists from wealthy countries were among the 230,000 victims, they all but ignored less visible crises in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, and Niger and its Sahel neighbours. That is unfortunate for both moral and economic reasons since it is cheaper to act to prevent a famine than to deal with the human consequences once they have occurred. The second issue is that in all these cases, as in Pakistan, responses would almost certainly have been faster if the UN central emergency fund had enough cash in it - Oxfam suggests $1 billion, the gap between annual income and needs - to permit rapid action. If the money was there it would be easier for governments or aid agencies to send other things - helicopters, for example - confident that they would be paid for. A proper UN fund would also ensure disasters were treated according to their needs, not on the basis of political preferences or media visibility: without Muslim Pakistan's status as a US ally in the ""war on terror,"" less help might have been forthcoming. The UN's flash appeal target has been met, but the question is if the generosity will be sustained when rescue and humanitarian work gives way to longer-term reconstruction. No-one has forgotten that half the money pledged after the Bam earthquake in Iran never arrived. With so many calls for help, donor fatigue is a very real problem. But a generation of Pakistani children lies dead under cheaply-built schools. Perhaps two million people are homeless as a cruel Himalayan winter approaches. What else does it take to stir the conscience of the world?",5893c1feee424152edfd1af0
2017-02-02T11:34:36Z,theguardian.com,2012-08-10,environment,Fukushima disaster paves way for new geothermal plants,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants,"Before last year's triple disaster in north-east Japan, Tsuchiyu Onsen drew tens of thousands of tourists in search of the recuperative qualities of its piping hot spring water. Almost 18 months after the nuclear accident at nearby Fukushima Daiichi power plant, that same natural resource is about to turn this spa resort into a trailblazer for the country's push towards renewable energy. By spring 2014, Tsuchiyu, 9 miles (15km) from Fukushima, will be generating 250 kilowatts of electricity – about a quarter of the city's total needs – at a geothermal plant hidden away in the surrounding mountains. The plant will be the first to be built inside a national park, a controversial move that only became possible after the environment ministry recently relaxed regulations on developing protected areas. If all goes to plan, the project could not only help the town become self-sufficient in power generation, but revive its role as a tourist destination after visitor numbers plummeted amid lingering fears over radiation. In the past, hot-spring operators have been among the fiercest opponents of geothermal energy, an obvious source of energy given Japan's huge subterranean reserves of volcanic water. Many fear the plants would affect the flow and quality of the water, which is pumped up from the depths and then cooled for the benefit of Japan's enthusiastic bathers. In Tsuchiyu, however, where half a dozen hotels remain closed with earthquake damage, spa owners are among the new geothermal generator's keenest backers. ""The plant won't affect the water quality or the temperature,"" said Kazuya Ikeda, general manager of the Tsuchiyu Onsen Tourist Association. ""We have surveyed opinion in the town, and no one has raised any objections."" The move also makes economic sense. Under a new feed-in tariff system introduced last month, utilities are required to pay premium prices for renewable energy – 42 yen (34p) per kilowatt for geothermal power. ""The structure itself will be quite small and unobtrusive,"" Ikeda added. ""And with the feed-in tariff, we should be able to cover our initial costs in about seven years."" The 300m-yen (£2.5m) facility will use water pumped from below ground and combine it with an ammonia-like substance with a lower boiling point than water to propel a turbine. Resistance to geothermal power, coupled with the pre-Fukushima faith in nuclear, means that until now Japan has failed to tap into a resource that energy experts believe has huge potential. Its 18 geothermal plants account for 0.2% of electricity output, according to the trade and industry ministry, and no new plants have been built for a decade. Scientists believe the sector's share could rise enormously thanks to the feed-in tariff, new subsidies to fund feasibility studies and test-drilling, and official recognition that nuclear's heyday has passed. According to one estimate, Japan's gGeothermal capacity could reach 24m kilowatts – the third biggest in the world after the US and Indonesia – compared with less than 550,000 kilowatts now. Tsuchiyu has other compelling reasons to embrace geothermal power. Visitor numbers dropped dramatically after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and while a recovery is under way, fears of radiation persist, even though recorded levels here pose no health threat. Profits from the venture will be used to repair three damaged hotels and rebuild three others that were destroyed in the earthquake. In the long term, Ikeda believes Tsuchiyu will become a model for other small towns struggling to find clean and stable sources of energy, while experts debate if nuclear has any role to play in Japan's future energy mix. If the experiment works, it should allay anxiety among other Onsen operators about potential damage to hot-spring water flows – the financial lifeblood of countless similar resorts around Japan. Eventually, the geothermal plant will be capable of generating 1,000 kilowatts, according to Ikeda. That is a tiny fraction of the capacity of just one of Fukushima Daiichi's now crippled reactors. But with opposition to nuclear restarts unlikely to waver, towns such as Tsuchiyu have no choice but to turn to alternatives, he said. ""If it hadn't been for the nuclear disaster, we would never have given this project a second thought.""",5893c20cee424132f8fd561e
2017-02-02T11:37:14Z,theguardian.com,2007-10-05,"environment, climatechange","Climate change disaster is upon us, warns UN",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/05/climatechange,"A record number of floods, droughts and storms around the world this year amount to a climate change ""mega disaster"", the United Nation's emergency relief coordinator, Sir John Holmes, has warned. Sir John, a British diplomat who is also known as the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said dire predictions about the impact of global warming on humanity were already coming true. ""We are seeing the effects of climate change. Any year can be a freak but the pattern looks pretty clear to be honest. That's why we're trying ... to say, of course you've got to deal with mitigation of emissions, but this is here and now, this is with us already,"" he said. As a measure of the worsening situation, Ocha, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - part of the UN secretariat that employs Sir John - has issued 13 emergency ""flash"" appeals so far this year. The number is three more than in 2005, which held the previous record. Two years ago only half the international disasters dealt with by Ocha had anything to do with the climate; this year all but one of the 13 emergency appeals is climate-related. ""And 2007 is not finished. We will certainly have more by the end of the year, I fear,"" added Sir John, who is in charge of channelling international relief efforts to disaster areas. More appeals were likely in the coming weeks, as floods hit west Africa. ""All these events on their own didn't have massive death tolls, but if you add all these little disasters together you get a mega disaster,"" he said. The only one of this year's emergency appeals not connected to the climate was an earthquake in Peru, in August. The others arose after an unprecedented string of catastrophic floods across much of Africa, south Asia and North Korea, and followed severe drought in southern Africa, Nicaragua's category-five hurricane, and extreme climate conditions in Bolivia, which brought both drought and floods. The Ocha appeals represent the tip of an iceberg since they are launched only with the agreement of the affected country. India was badly affected by floods that hit the rest of the Asian region in July. But unlike its neighbour, Pakistan, India did not call on the UN for help. Ocha believes that 66 million people were made homeless or were otherwise affected across south Asia. The lives of several million more people were turned upside down across Africa. Sudan, Mozambique, Madagascar, Zambia and Uganda experienced disastrous floods, and Swaziland and Lesotho declared emergencies because of severe drought that reduced harvests by half. The latest appeal from Ocha was launched yesterday, to try to raise emergency relief funds for Ghana, where more than 400,000 people are reported to be homeless as a result of flooding. Appeals may also be started for Togo and Burkina Faso. ""The flooding in Africa just now is the worst anyone can remember,"" Sir John said, expressing frustration at how little media attention in the west was being devoted to what he terms creeping climatic catastrophe. Flooding is likely to be common for a warming planet, and climate change has a double effect - causing an increase in the frequency of storms, while higher atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide curb the ability of plants to draw groundwater. A climate-change summit is to be held in Bali in December, with the aim of agreeing the principles of a new international treaty to replace Kyoto, the accord that expires in 2012. But the talks face determined US opposition to mandatory emissions targets, and most climate negotiators doubt a real breakthrough can be achieved before the Bush government leaves office in 2009. Sir John argues that whatever is done on greenhouse gas emissions, money has to be spent now on mitigating the impact that climate change is already having. ""You can't actually stop disasters happening but you can do a lot to reduce their impact and reduce people's vulnerability to them by making sure people don't live on the coast or river plains, and that roads are raised and dams are in reasonable shape."" According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is leading research on the issue, global warming will disrupt and potentially devastate the lives of billions of people. And, just as global warming starts to make itself felt, there are signs that ""donor fatigue"" has set in. Of about $338m (£166m) requested for Ocha's 13 flash appeals this year, only $114m has so far come from donors.",5893c2aaee42415149dc3f39
2017-02-02T11:39:13Z,theguardian.com,2006-09-15,"environment, climatechange.climatechangeenvironment1",Warning: bigger carbon cut needed to avoid disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/15/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment1,"Drastic action is needed if Britain is to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change, a ground-breaking environmental report warns today. In the first big study of what households, business and government may have to do to cut carbon emissions, the leading climate change research body has revised upwards by 50% the cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that need to be achieved by 2050. The government-funded Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research says this is necessary because successive governments have failed to include aviation or shipping emissions in their calculations. At the moment, the government's estimate is that a 60% cut in emissions is needed to avoid a 2C increase in temperatures by 2050. But the authors of today's study conclude that a 90% cut in emissions is needed. Their data suggests that when aviation and shipping is factored in, UK carbon emissions have not fallen at all since 1990. In a scathing report commissioned by Friends of the Earth and the Cooperative Bank, the Tyndall Centre academics lambast successive governments for misleading the public on what has been achieved and what needs to be done. ""The government's carbon reduction policies continue to be informed by a partial inventory which omits the two important and rapidly growing sectors of air transport and shipping ... There is a clear void between the scale of the problem and the actual policy mechanisms proposed,"" the report says. It proposes radical ideas to effect change, predicting that most buildings will have to generate their own electricity, double-decker trains will transport people to work, and planes might not be allowed to take off unless they are nearly full. But the report says that 90% cuts are achievable if measures are taken within four years to stabilise emissions. Beyond 2010, it says, annual cuts of 9% will be needed for the next 20 years. If the measures are not introduced urgently, say the authors, much more drastic and much less manageable cuts will be needed later. The authors say that little new technology or investment in infrastructure will be needed to reduce emissions, apart from the development of hydrogen as a fuel, and carbon capture as a way to store carbon dioxide. Instead they say that the government can encourage all sectors of society to become far more energy efficient, generating their own power and saving energy at all points. However, they propose that Britain become the first country in the world to introduce a wide-ranging carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. They envisage that everyone would be able to trade emissions, with those who do not use much energy able to sell their quotas to those who use a lot. They also propose that aviation, the fastest growing emitter of carbon dioxide, be given a stringent cap on its emissions. ""The UK has reached a tipping point. If the government's carbon dioxide targets are actually to have meaning the government must act now to curb dramatically the nation's carbon dioxide emissions,"" says the report. ""The message is stark. We are deluding ourselves [if we] wait for technology or emission trading to offer a smooth transition to a low carbon future. The real challenge is making a radical shift within four years and driving down carbon intensity at an unprecedented 9% a year for up to 20 years."" Tony Juniper, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: ""To turn this road map into reality we need a law that commits this and future governments to making annual cuts in the UK's carbon emissions. Without legislation to force government to reduce emissions annually, politicians will continue to place short-term gains ahead of the long-term decisions needed to get to grips with climate change."" Dr Kevin Anderson, research director of the Tyndall Centre's energy and climate change programme, said: ""Our research demonstrates that the UK can move to a low carbon economy. But the journey will become much more demanding the longer the government leaves it to act."" He added: ""To make a smooth transition to a low carbon future the individuals need immediately to begin to implement a major action programme."" Railways By 2030, railways could be entering their greatest era. Trains are expected to remain the most carbon efficient mode of transport after cycling and walking, and the authors expect the British network to grow by 25% in 25 years as people forsake short haul flights for a new generation of high-speed trains linking national and European urban centres. By 2030, the authors say, double-decker trains could be introduced to increase capacity. Not only will passenger numbers grow, but operators will be encouraged to run longer and fuller trains on more energy efficient fuels. Rail freight will increase, but will be curtailed because the existing lines will be used more for passenger traffic. Track improvements will also be needed to reduce emissions. Industry If Britain is to meet a 90% cut in emissions, the government must slow energy consumption and shift the economy towards renewables. The biggest emission savings, say the authors, will come from capturing and storing carbon emissions from coal and gas, and the generation of wave, wind and tidal energy. By 2030, the authors expect wood and fuel crops to be heating public buildings and housing estates, and up to 36% of all electricity to come from renewables, compared with less than 5% today and 10% in 2010. A further 15% will come from ""on site"" micro-generation by buildings and appliances. A big change in industrial processes and technologies will be needed, and reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions will become essential in industrial design. Energy demand from appliances may overall stay the same but the emissions from air conditioning, refrigerators, computers and mobile phones can be greatly decreased. By 2050, industry will be located in hubs, so the waste heat from one manufacturing process is used by another. It will be far less carbon intensive when it uses hydrogen instead of gas and starts generating its own renewable electricity. By 2050, hydrogen fuel made from both fossil fuels and renewables will be used widely by industry for transport and heating. Hydrogen fuel will also be produced at filling stations by a process called renewable electrolysis, with huge arrays of solar panels placed on embankments. Roads Cars and cities will have to transform themselves by 2030 if the UK is to meet its carbon reduction targets. The biggest emission savings will come from the shift from oil to alternative fuels, and as cities effectively ban private transport from their centres. By 2030 the Tyndall report says there may be 13% fewer cars on the roads a wider choice of fuels including electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels. A network of ""multi-fuel"" filling stations will be needed. Cars will generally be lighter and more efficient. In the short and medium term, say the authors, the government could increase road tax on inefficient vehicles, decrease the speed limit on motorways to 60mph, set minimum emission standards for company car fleets and encourage public transport. By 2050, the authors say most cars will be run on fuel cells or by electricity and emissions could have reduced to practically nothing. Buildings Anticipating population growth, and a shift of people to the south, the authors expect roughly 2m new buildings in the next 45 years, but say that if high construction standards are introduced they need add little or nothing to overall CO2 emissions. But they consider some existing houses to be so energy inefficient that they may have to be demolished. By 2030, the majority of homes would have highly efficient insulation and roofs, and would have begun to generate their own electricity from wind turbines and solar panels. In addition, the government could ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs in favour of LEDs. The authors suggest that by 2030, all individuals could be part of a carbon emission trading scheme, allowing people who do not travel much or burn much energy to trade quotas with those who are energy profligate. By 2050, little energy will be needed to heat or cool buildings. Aviation Over the next decade the aviation industry will come under intense pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It can achieve big cuts by developing lighter planes that burn less carbon-intensive fuels, and could also return to more efficient turboprop planes for short flights. Governments could demand speed limits on planes, ban larger ones from short haul flights and allow them to take off only if they are at least half full. The Tyndall authors expect biofuels increasingly to be grown for aviation over the next 25 years and suggest that the government could increase the tax on flying. In addition, a moratorium could be put on runway building, aviation could be brought into an emission trading scheme and the industry could be given a cap on emissions. By 2050, the authors say, domestic aviation will have greatly decreased as people shift to high-speed trains, and a combination of greater fuel efficiency and restraint encouraged by personal emission trading could reduce greenhouse gases from air travel to about one third of today's level.",5893c321ee424152183c47c5
2017-02-02T11:44:06Z,theguardian.com,2010-09-09,environment,BP oil spill report lists series of failures - mostly by others - that led to disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/08/bp-oil-spill-failures,"""The well is blowing out ... [one of the technicians] is shutting it in now."" That call was made aboard the Deepwater oil rig at 21.45 on 20 April, but was fatally optimistic. Within four minutes, two giant explosions had set the rig ablaze, killing 11 people and injuring 17 more. The ""nightmare well"", as it had been dubbed by some workers, had become a real world horror. The minute-by-minute timeline in the report released by BP today, along with the astonishing catalogue of errors and failures the report details, paints a vivid picture of both the terror of that night on the rig and the extraordinary lapses in safety. The catastrophe, which led to the spilling of five million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, began some time before 19.55 local time, deep below the sea. Oil and gas started forcing its way into the well bore, breaching a cement barrier. Without naming the cement contractor, Halliburton, the BP investigators made their opinion clear: ""There were weaknesses in cement design and testing, quality assurance and risk assessment."" Two further barriers, in the so-called ""shoe track"" at the base of the well, then failed as the intense pressure of the hydrocarbons came to bear on them. Next came perhaps the most crucial mistake. Pressure readings were taken on the well to determine whether it was under control, but despite ""anomalies"" the test was considered ""good"". BP's report accepts some of the responsibility but also blames the Transocean rig crew for reaching the ""incorrect view that the test was successful"". That was at 19.55, and all must have seemed well on the rig, but below their feet the storm was gathering. The report estimates that at 21.38, hydrocarbons burst through the well and into the riser, the pipe leading up to the rig. Within three minutes, mud had shot up through the derrick on the rig, the first warning blast, and from here events unfolded at breakneck speed. As the mud spurted, a valve was closed diverting the flow to a device that separated mud from gas - another crucial mistake. This brought the full force of the blown well directly onto the rig, rather than venting it overboard. At 21.45, as mud was ""raining down on the deck"" and the well pressure was trebling, the call was made to shut the well. In the following minutes, high pressure gas was discharging towards the deck, vibrating the huge rig. The sirens of one gas alarm after another went off, and the drill pipe pressure rose another fivefold. By 21.49, just four minutes after the call to shut the well was made, the rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost. The darkness of the Gulf night lasted just five seconds. A huge explosion hit the rig followed by another one 10 seconds later. The fate of Deepwater, and the biggest offshore oil spill in history, was set. Those four minutes contained another series of terrible failures. The bursting of gas and oil into the wellbore pushed up pressure readings 40 minutes earlier, but it was 40 minutes before any action was taken. Once again, the BP report blames the rig crew - Transocean. Next was the decision to route the flow of the hydrocarbons onto the rig, to the mud gas separator. Without that decision, ""there may have been more time to respond, and the consequences of the accident may have been reduced"" says the BP report. The onslaught of hydrocarbons overwhelmed the separator and allowed them to burst into parts of the rig that were not designed to suppress electrical sparks, via the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, with explosive consequences. At 21.52, the Mayday call went out, as the rig crew tried to ensure the blowout preventer - the 450-tonne set of valves on the sea floor and the ultimate failsafe - was in operation. As they did, 115 people began to leave the rig by a nearby ship. The coastguard were at the rig by 23.22. Eleven hours later the rig sank and oil began to pour into the gulf. The failure of the blowout preventer was the final, catastrophic lapse. BP's report found that the explosions and fire on the rig very likely disabled the ""emergency disconnect sequence"", the primary emergency response that was supposed the seal the well. An automatic system, meant to kick in if power from the rig was lost, also failed, for the prosaic and appalling reason that the batteries in one control pod were flat and a crucial valve in the other was faulty. Two days later, the Macondo well delivered the final insult. Robot submarines had made it to the seabed and operated the shear valve that was meant to seal the well. It didn't. Transocean's response to BP's report has been scathing: ""This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design. In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk – in some cases, severely."" Stephen Davis was on board Deepwater and told the Guardian in May about his memory of that night of chaos: the sensation of being flung five metres into a wall by a powerful explosion, the desperate, muddy scramble on a deck lit only by the reflections from a huge pillar of flame; the look in men's eyes before they jumped 18 metres (60ft) into the water. ""You could taste the fumes, that godawful taste in your mouth. It was hard to breathe. The oxygen was being sucked out of the living quarters. Then all of a sudden – just boom. It was the biggest explosion I ever heard in my life."" ""The whole rig was vibrating and shaking,"" he said. ""It's like we walked straight into hell.""",5893c446ee42414e83d607e7
2017-02-02T11:44:14Z,theguardian.com,2010-09-09,environment,Gulf oil disaster: BP admits missing warning signs hours before blast,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/08/deepwater-horizon-rig-bp-report,"BP admitted today its managers on the Deepwater Horizon missed key warning signs in the hours before the explosion aboard the oil rig, but an internal investigation put much of the blame on other companies involved in the well. A 234-page report described eight main causes for the blast, which killed 11 men and created an environmental disaster. But BP was accused of attempting to pass on the blame for its conclusion that Transocean, the rig owner, and Halliburton, which carried out cement work, shared much of the responsibility. Mark Bly, the oil company's head of safety and the leader of the investigation, admitted that BP onsite managers could have prevented the catastrophe had they picked up warning signs of a breach of the cement seal at the bottom of the well, as well as unusual pressure test readings, only moments before the explosion. He told reporters in Washington: ""Given everything that came before, there probably should have been more risk assessment. They probably should have been more careful."" The report was widely seen as a possible preview of BP's legal strategy. The oil company was accused of trying to reduce the chances of being charged with gross negligence, which would expose it to possible criminal proceedings and billions of dollars in damage. Within hours of its release, Transocean and Halliburton accused BP of attempting to shift attention from its own mistakes of bad well design and disregard of safety procedures. Members of Congress and environmentalists also dismissed it. Transocean said: ""This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident: BP's fatally flawed well design."" Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said the report was more about protecting BP's interests than getting to the cause of the disaster. ""BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece,"" he said. Environmental organisations were more scathing. ""BPs investigation doesn't pass the smell test ,"" said Kieran Suckling, the director of the Centre for Biological Diversity. ""This report is more concerned with calming BP shareholders than taking responsibility for its actions."" There were similar sentiments in the Gulf. Alfred Sunseri, whose family-owned oyster company faces ruin after the spill, said: ""When BP shows me a report of how exactly they will deal with those people most impacted by this tragedy – ie those in the fisheries-related businesses – I'll believe they are not just using their talents in public relations to dispel their liability."" Bly acknowledged the report fails to address the key charges raised in Congress and elsewhere against the oil company: that it allowed a culture of recklessness to flourish, and that it was so anxious to finish work on a project that was 43 days over time and $20m (£13m) over budget that it omitted standard industry safeguards. The report does recognise there were gaping lapses in oversight on the Deepwater Horizon, going on to make 25 recommendations for tighter scrutiny by well owners – such as BP –of rig operations. But Bly rejected the idea that cost-cutting had dictated BP's decisions on the rig, saying: ""What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information."" Oil companies could be facing tougher regulation anyway: the White House said it was asking for more funds from Congress to step up oil rig inspections. The report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures. It is also closely focused on the rig itself. No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers. The investigation identifies eight main causes of the explosion, putting particular blame on well integrity. It says Halliburton's choice of foam cement for the area around the well casing failed to produce a strong enough seal. Tony Hayward, who was BP's chief executive at the time of the explosion, said in a statement: ""To put it simply, there was a bad cement job."" Halliburton said it had carried out its work to BP specifications. The report also said the blowout preventer, the last line of defence once there is a breach, had failed. There, BP pointed at Transocean noting that the battery pack on the blowout preventer had been allowed to run low. But Bly said the disaster may have been prevented had work crews – BP's as well as Transocean's – spotted the crucial warning signs in a series of anomalous pressure test readings in the run-up to the explosion. ""A fundamental to well control is early detection,"" he said. The pressure test readings should have alerted crews to the escape of oil and gas from the well reservoir, he said. The report is far from the final word on the explosion and the subsequent oil spill, with Transocean, Congress and the federal government carrying out investigations. But Robert Gordon, a lawyer for businesses affected by the spill, said it was unlikely to carry much weight in the months ahead. ""BP blaming others for the Gulf oil disaster is like Bernie Madoff blaming his accountant,"" he said.",5893c44eee42414e83d60812
2017-02-02T11:54:36Z,theguardian.com,2008-07-24,"environment, food.kenya","Rising food prices pushing east Africa to disaster, warns Oxfam",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/24/food.kenya,"More than 14 million people in the east Africa region require urgent food aid due to drought and spiralling cereal and fuel prices, aid agencies say. In an emergency appeal launched today, Oxfam warns that millions of people in Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Djibouti and Kenya are fast being pushed ""towards severe hunger and destitution"". Earlier this week the UN said it needed £200m to avert a humanitarian disaster. The hunger crisis is worse than the last regional emergency in 2006, when drought caused 11 million people to need assistance, because of the added impact of the global food price increases. Poor families are struggling to buy staples such as maize and wheat, which have more than doubled in price over the past 12 months. ""In previous droughts most people on the margins found ways to cope,"" said Peter Smerdon, of the World Food Programme. ""But the simultaneous increase in food prices this time around means they are cutting down on meals and taking their kids out of school in order to try to get by. More people are falling over the edge."" Ethiopia is worst affected, with more than 10 million people requiring assistance following two poor rainy seasons. About 4.6 million need emergency food aid until the next harvest in November - rain is now falling in some areas - while a further 5.7 million on safety-net programmes require additional food or cash grants. At least 75,000 children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The sharp increase in the fuel price has added to the cost of getting food around the country. Oxfam says that in the remote Somali and Afar regions, cereal prices have increased by up to 500%, while livestock are dying due to lack of water. In Somalia the rice price has more than tripled since May 2007. Drought and mass displacement caused by civil war mean that 2.6 million people require food aid - a number that could rise to 3.5 million. Delivering the relief is difficult due to piracy and the targeting of aid workers by militias. In Djibouti 115,000 people require assistance, while in Uganda's eastern Karamoja district, the figure is 700,000. In Kenya, 900,000 people need help. Normally, the WFP buys relief food from regional governments, but is having to import food from India and South Africa. The Ethiopian government has used up its emergency cereal reserves to feed the urban poor, while Uganda and Kenya are reluctant to sell the small stocks they have. Earlier appeals by the UN for help in tackling the Somalian and Ethiopian food crises have only been a third funded. Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's chief executive, said the UK public had the right to question why the appeals ""happen year after year"". ""The answer is that the world consistently fails to address adequately the underlying causes of these crises. Chronic poverty in a world of gross inequality of wealth and opportunity lie at the heart of these cyclical crises,"" she said.",5893c6bcee424150a7e42097
2017-02-02T11:58:19Z,theguardian.com,2008-07-07,"environment, climatechange.drought","Climate change report like a disaster novel, says Australian minister",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/07/climatechange.drought,"A new report by Australia's top scientists predicts that the country will be hit by a 10-fold increase in heatwaves and that droughts will almost double in frequency and become more widespread because of climate change. The scientific projections envisage rainfall continuing to decline in a country that is already one of the hottest and driest in the world. It says that about 50% of the decrease in rainfall in south-western Australia since the 1950s has probably been due to greenhouse gases. Yesterday, Australia's agriculture minister, Tony Burke, described the report as alarming and said: ""Parts of these high-level projections read more like a disaster novel than a scientific report."" The analysis, commissioned by the government as part of a review of public funding to drought-stricken farmers, was published days after another report, by Professor Ross Garnaut, warned that Australia had to adopt a scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 or face the eventual destruction of sites including the Great Barrier Reef, the wetlands of Kakadu and the nation's food bowl, the Murray-Darling Basin. The prime minister, Kevin Rudd, who swept to victory on a green agenda last November, said the analysis by the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation was ""very disturbing"". The reports will put pressure on him to act swiftly on his pledge for Australia to lead the world in tackling polluters. However, the rising cost of living has dented his government's popularity and his plans for a carbon trading scheme have begun to unnerve voters and industry. Rudd has acknowledged that tough debate lies ahead and has said the government will map out its policy options this month. Yesterday's report revealed that not only would droughts occur more often but that the area affected would be twice as large as now. The proportion of the country having exceptionally hot years could increase from 5% each year to as much as 95%, according to the projections. The report says rainfall in Australia has been declining since the 1950s and about half of that decrease is due to climate change. It says the current thresholds for farmers to claim financial assistance are out of date because hotter and drier weather will become the norm. Burke said it was clear that the cycle of drought was going to be ""more regular and deeper than ever before"". He added: ""If we failed to review drought policy, if we were to continue the neglect and pretend that the climate wasn't changing, we would be leaving our farms out to dry."" Parts of Australia are now in a sixth year of drought, and the report coincided with an announcement that there has been a worsening of the drought in New South Wales. Some 65% of the state is affected, an increase of more than 2.3% on last month, although opinion is divided on whether it can be attributed to climate change. A plague of locusts is also threatening crops in the state, with farmers on 900 farms reporting finding locust eggs. The government plans to fight the infestation with aerial spraying before the eggs hatch.",5893c79bee424150a7e424a3

""The effects of Chernobyl on human health will continue for many years to come in the form of anything from an abnormal limb to an extremely severe cancer,"" explained Dr Tony Nicholson, the vice-president of the Royal College of Radiologists and dean of its clinical radiology faculty. Radiation damages men's sperm and women's eggs, meaning their children can be born with congenital defects such as a serious heart condition or brain abnormality. ""Some of these defects will be fatal, others will require surgery to correct them and all will severely affect the child's quality of life,"" said Nicholson. Women exposed to radiation also have a much higher chance of miscarriage. Radiation also produces cancer of the lymph glands and thyroid cancers. ""Children in Ukraine are still suffering the effects of Chernobyl 23 years on,"" said Nicholson, ""but if a child is born with cancer in Poland near the border with Ukraine, you can't be sure that [it] wasn't related to Chernobyl."" ""None of those who survive exposure radiation have received a big enough dose to kill them. But many will suffer the effects of the radiation for the rest of their lives,"" added Nicholson.

2017-02-03T12:00:22Z,theguardian.com,2007-05-31,"environment, climatechange.conservation","World's great apes face disaster, says Leakey",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/31/climatechange.conservation,"One of the world's most prominent conservation experts yesterday issued a rallying cry to save the great apes, man's closest biological cousins, which are under serious threat of extinction. Richard Leakey, former head of the Kenya wildlife service and now chair of Wildlife Direct, said apes across the world faced unprecedented threats from the combined effects of hunting, disease and logging. And he said efforts to tackle global warming through the use of biofuels could cause more damage to ape populations because of pressure to chop down their tropical forest homes. About 80% of orang-utan habitat in south-east Asia has been destroyed in the past 20 years because of soaring demand for land to produce palm oil for western markets. Experts warn that increased uptake of alternative fuels could mean the disappearance of the remaining 50,000 animals there within a generation. Dr Leakey, who will outline his concerns in a public lecture tonight at the Royal Geographical Society in London, said human activity was directly to blame for the deaths of millions of gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos across the world. He urged politicians working on a new international treaty to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to focus more on incentives to conserve forests across south-east Asia, Africa and central and south America. Dr Leakey said: ""People shrug their shoulders and say what are poor countries to do if they can't export their natural resources, and I understand this, but it is simply not sustainable the way it is going. The threat to great ape populations around the world is growing visibly."" He said preventing deforestation would help curb global warming as well as preserving endangered apes. Carbon released by deforestation is reckoned to account for 25% of all human greenhouse gas emissions, second only to the energy generation sector. Scientists say conserving forests offers one of the cheapest ways to tackle climate change, and steps to reward tropical countries which leave their forests untouched will be discussed at the G8 summit in Germany next week. Dr Leakey, a patron of a United Nations Environment Programme great apes survival project, called for more ""imaginative"" solutions such as credits for preserving biodiversity and wildlife habitats which a country could sell to others to offset their carbon pollution. ""We find it very hard to preserve natural beauty, but we are happy to spend £80m on a Picasso and a fortune looking after it."" But he insisted developing countries must take their share of responsibility for global warming. ""Developing countries are shrill about the damage that developed countries have caused with their pollution,"" he said. ""The developing world should have a comparable amount of responsibility because of deforestation. I don't think we [Kenya] can afford to shelter behind the fact that we're a new country and we were grossly exploited before, and so we need to be given a break. We need to look at the effect we're having on the whole planet."" He called for a ""huge revolution in entrepreneurial skills"" to develop technology such as nuclear fusion and hydrogen power as a way of limiting the need for biofuels. ""The whole biofuel issue is of great concern. And it's not just biofuels, the destruction of rainforest to make way for palm oil plantations is extraordinary."" A UN report this month also raised concerns over a rapid expansion of biofuels, saying they could have an irreversible environmental impact. There are also concerns about their impact on global food prices, with growing competition for scarce land resources. Dr Leakey said the direct effects of climate change could spell disaster for the great apes. ""I don't think we can say enough to stimulate concern over climate change. It's a complex process but it will undoubtedly impact on everything we know and the implications for biodiversity are there for all to see. We don't know the tolerance of plants to the predicted temperature changes. We should not for a minute assume that forests, rivers and lakes are permanent features of our landscape."" He also criticised what he called the ""oxymoron"" of ecotourism, which he said was based on ""a desperate race to make money while you still can"". He said: ""An awful lot of damage is done under the umbrella of ecotourism. The tourism industry needs to be talked to very seriously about setting standards that are something other than profit-motivated."" Profile: Richard Leakey Born in Kenya in 1944 to two esteemed anthropologists, Richard Leakey led expeditions which uncovered a steady stream of human-ancestor fossils during the 1970s which dazzled the scientific world and helped to clarify our evolutionary history. Among the most important finds are the remains of Turkana Boy, a 1.6m-year-old Homo erectus skeleton, recovered virtually intact, as well as the 2.5m-year-old Black Skull, which forced palaeontologists to drastically rethink the structure of the human family tree. In 1969 he was diagnosed with a terminal kidney disease and a decade later received a lifesaving transplant from his younger brother. In the 1980s he devoted more of his time to Kenya's museums and, subsequently, conservation issues. From 1989 to 1994, as head of the Kenya wildlife service, he beefed up the country's national parks and led high-profile and successful campaigns against elephant poaching. In 1993 he lost both legs below the knee when the plane he was piloting malfunctioned and crashed. Rumours of sabotage were never proven. In the mid-1990s he entered Kenyan politics, first as co-founder of a new opposition party, and then in government at the invitation of former president Daniel arap Moi.",5893c816ee42415149dc57fc
2017-02-03T12:03:12Z,theguardian.com,2010-06-15,environment,"US Congress to tell BP boss: you broke rules, cut costs and it ended in disaster",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/14/barack-obama-oil-spill-speech,"BP is being accused by a US congressional committee of ignoring warnings, violating its own industry guidelines, and choosing risky procedures in the hope of cutting costs and saving time in the days leading up to the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive, was served notice on Monday by the committee on energy and commerce that it intends to subject him to the most rigorous inquisition the company has yet faced in the 56-day-old crisis. A letter from the committee's chairman, Henry Waxman, said ""time after time, it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense"". Hayward's hearing will take place on Thursday, towards the end of a crucial week in which the tensions between US politicians and BP are likely to escalate. Barack Obama will tonight make his first address to the American people from the Oval Office, underlining the scale of the catastrophe now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and vowing to hold BP to account for the environmental damage wrought by its eight-week-old oil spill. Obama is expected to use the speech to outline plans to force the firm to set up an independently monitored multibillion-dollar fund to compensate victims of the spill. He will also lay out a detailed timeline of how the worst of the calamity could be contained. Hours before the broadcast, the energy and environment sub-committee of the House of Representatives will call senior BP officials in front of it to answer questions on the company's handling of the crisis. Then tomorrow, Obama will hold his first meeting with a team of top BP staff led by the chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, and expected to include Hayward who has so far avoided a face-to-face encounter with the president. But it will be the forensic questioning of Hayward in front of Thursday's committee on energy and commerce upon which BP's fate now potentially hangs. Waxman's advance letter runs to 14 pages and contains damaging allegations gathered during previous hearings. Five days before the 20 April explosion, the letter contends, BP was warned by its own drilling engineer that this was a ""nightmare well"". Yet the firm went on to make five crucial decisions that the committee alleges put profit before safety. BP, at this point, was up against the clock, attempting to complete drilling so that the Deepwater Horizon rig could be moved to another location, avoiding overrun costs. The five accusations levelled at BP by the committee are: • That it adopted a cheap design for the well, choosing a single casing rather than a more sophisticated design, despite the fact that its own analysis found strongly in favour of the latter. ""The decision appears to have been made to save time and reduce costs,"" the letter says. • BP went with the cheapest option of using just six ""centralisers"", which hold the casing in the centre of the borehole, despite being advised by its contractors Halliburton to use 21. Halliburton warned that the well had a ""SEVERE gas flow problem"" and that using six centralisers would risk the success of the procedure. • BP decided not to carry out an acoustic test designed to measure the efficacy of the cementing of the well to block off gas flows. The test would have cost $128,000 and taken an extra 12 hours. An independent engineer who gave evidence to the committee said it was ""unheard of"" not to perform the test and slammed the decision as being ""horribly negligent"". • BP failed to check the proper workings of the new well system by circulating drilling mud from its bottom to the surface. Halliburton suggested the lack of a full test was due to BP's desire for speed. • The firm did not install a critical piece of equipment that locks the wellhead and the casing at the level of the sea floor. The absence of the ""lockdown sleeve"" has been identified as one possible cause of the explosion. Waxman's letter concludes that BP must answer to the committee for possible ""carelessness and complacency"" that ""inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf, its inhabitants and the workers on the rig. The new offensive by Congress came as Obama began a two-day visit to the stricken region. After he had landed in Gulfport, Mississippi, he likened the environmental impact of the Deep Horizon explosion to the impact on the national psyche of 9/11. In an interview with the website Politico, he said: ""In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11, I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come."" The comparison drew some angry responses from families of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. BP has now passed a 72-hour ultimatum set for it by the Obama administration to come up with a more focused plan for how to bring the spill under control. Worst-case scenarios, estimated by US government scientists, suggest that up to 40,000 barrels of oil could be spewing out into the Gulf each day, with only 15,000 barrels currently being collected by a cap placed over the wrecked well. The company has outlined a series of methods it intends to implement that it claims will see the amount of captured oil rise to up to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July. The 'ass kickers' Henry Waxman The Democrat congressman is famous for in 1994 forcing chiefs of tobacco giants to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive. He will seek the same killer punch against Tony Hayward on Thursday, when BP's CEO appears before a panel of the House energy and commerce committee. Expect him to press Hayward hard on whether BP put profit before safety. Ed Markey With a long track record of holding power to account – from the nuclear electricity industry to the US government over torture – Markey has become a leading critic of BP's handling of the Deepwater Horizon crisis. ""They are either incompetent or they are lying,"" he has said of BP chiefs. Today the Democratic congressman will call BP America's president, Lamar McKay, as well as the bosses of rival oil companies in front of his House energy and environment sub-committee. Likely line of questioning: why BP's estimates of the size of the spill have been so massively wide of the mark. Robert Gibbs Barack Obama's press spokesman, who has been ""kicking ass"" on the president's behalf, has been accused of whipping up anti-British feeling by referring to British Petroleum rather than BP, the firm's rebranded name. He has also used such fruity language as: ""We will keep our boot on the throat of BP"". Gibbs says the administration is just focused on what's right. Thad Allen The US coastguard admiral who Obama put in charge of the clean-up operation last week issued BP with a 72-hour ultimatum to come up with solid plans on how to contain the leak. Allen has been careful in his criticisms of BP until now, saying it has generally been co-operative. But daily media exposure of Allen, in which he has come across as energetic and action-oriented, has only served to make BP look all the more incompetent.",5893c8c0ee42414e83d61b50

Obama's visit is his fourth since the gusher began, but the first so far to Mississippi, Albama, and Florida, which are now joining Louisiana on the frontline of the spill. Several miles of Alabama's beaches were splattered with a thick sludge of oil at the weekend, with a slick now three or four miles off the Florida resort of Pensacola. Two barrier islands off Mississippi were also covered in oil. In Panama City, Florida, 190 miles from the ruptured well, a steel tank was discovered, oozing oil, that appeared to come from the sunken Deepwater Horizon rig. Obama's two-day visit is the latest attempt by the White House to assert the president's mastery over the spill crisis – a difficult case to make given that BP and his administration admit the oil will continue to spew until at least August. He also has a tricky task of balancing public pressure to get tough on BP with economic and diplomatic concerns. That task will be put to the test on his return from the Gulf with a television address from the Oval Office on Tuesday night, and a meeting with BP's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, on Wednesday. At Alabama's Orange Beach, at the western edge of a stretch of highrise hotels and condominiums that some call the Redneck Riviera, the oil was washing up in thick lumps faster than the hundreds of cleanup workers could shovel it up. ""This absolutely sucks,"" said Carolyn Kerin, coming off the beach with her three children. None were swimming. Two red flags were flying, indicating that swimmers would face fines and penalties – not that Kerin would let her children in the water anyway. ""Ewww,"" she said. Was she impressed with Obama's handling of the crisis so far? ""I don't think he did everything he could do. I think he was way too slow to act like he was serious."" Further down the beach, opinion was divided. A man held up a sign for TV cameras reading: ""We've been BPeed on."" Overhead, a propeller plane flew a banner reading: ""Look Obama 54 days and still nothing."" The summer holidays have just started here and normally the beaches would be a crush of umbrellas and tanned bodies, with traffic jams stretching for miles. But this weekend, the car parks were packed with pickup trucks and tractors from the cleanup crews. The sands were mainly empty, barring the workers in their rubber boots and gloves shovelling up the clumps of oil that washed up to 3.5 metres (12ft) up the beach, and dumping the stuff in plastic rubbish bags. But the oil was landing ashore as fast as they could clean. A few workers admitted they had cleaned the exact same patch of sand earlier in the day. ""It is a liquid and it is very difficult to pick it up mechanically and pick it up physically,"" Alabama's governor, Bob Riley, told CBS television today. ""We are trying to find something to coagulate it today so we can pick it up."" Others also had problems to attend to. At 3pm yesterday, Judy Robertson was so jittery, walking up to each new arrival to ask if they were with the wedding party she was organising. The event planner has had three brides cancel – and that was before any of the oil reached the beach. Now she said she was expecting a wave of lost bookings. Looking down the beach at a tractor pulling bundled up bags, she said: ""My grandkids are not going to know what a beach is if it continues like this. We are not going to be able to swim here. It's going to destroy our economy."" Robertson, like many of the people in this solidly Republican part of the country, was never a supporter of Obama. ""To me he's not presidential material,"" she said. Obama's earlier attempts to show his control over events, including the threat to ""kick ass"", may have made Robertson dislike him even more. ""That's what teenagers say. It's not official. He talks like he's just some worker on a beach,"" she said. Striking the right balance will be a difficult challenge for Obama during his visit. This was hostile territory even before the oil spill. On the ground a lot of people accuse their fellow Americans of rushing to New York's aid after 9/11 while ignoring hurricane Katrina and this latest tragedy to befall the Gulf. ""It's like we are Haiti,"" said one popular US radio host. BP is also less than willing to act as Obama's fall guy. As preparations got underway for the White House visit the oil company was moving to mollify local opinion, with BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, appearing in local TV adverts to offer a personal apology for the spill. ""The gulf spill is a tragedy that never should have happened,"" he said. ""We will get this done. We will make it right."" The governors of Mississippi and Alabama want reassurances that Obama will continue to support offshore oil drilling, and are pressing him to end his six-month moratorium on new projects. Florida's governor, however, wants the president to introduce an outright ban. But all three want assurances from Obama that BP will make good on its promise to pay for the spill cleanup and any economic losses. Such fears have heightened in recent days, with Louisiana's treasurer warning that BP could face bankruptcy. The governors are also trying to stave off the collapse of their tourist industries. ""Most of the experience of coming to the Gulf coast is still as great as it's ever been,"" Riley said. ""Rent a condo, play golf."" Or take souvenirs of the spill. At Orange Beach, a few people came with cameras to take snaps of the sludge. Kevin Kaullen, an environmental engineer from near San Diego, California, arrived with battles to take samples of the water. Otherwise the idea of helping Alabamans out by taking an eco-disaster holiday was not finding many takers, even among neighbouring Louisianans, who are going through their own economic pain owing to the spill. On a local talk radio station, a host mused about how much of a discount on a condo it would take to make a beach holiday without an actual beach experience an attractive proposition. ""A 40% discount?"" he said. ""I don't think I would go for 40%. It would have to be at least 60.""",5893c8cdee42414e83d61b84

The Transocean report released on Wednesday said the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April 2010 and resulting oil spill was the result of a succession of well design, construction, and temporary abandonment decisions that compromised the integrity of the well and compounded the risk of its failure. The Swiss firm said many of the decisions were made by well owner BP in the two weeks before the incident. Transocean said its evidence indicates that BP failed to properly assess, manage and communicate risk. BP's own internal report on the disaster blamed a cascade of failures by multiple companies. Government investigations also have spread around the blame. The findings by all of the various sides will be argued about for months and perhaps years to come as numerous lawsuits make their way through court. The companies involved in the disaster have sued each other seeking to recoup their losses or expected losses from the disaster. BP officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In addition to owning the well that blew out, London-based BP was leasing the rig that exploded from Transocean. Eleven rig workers were killed and the government estimates some 206 million gallons of oil spewed from BP's Macondo well one mile (1.6km) beneath the sea before the well was capped three months later. It was the worst offshore oil spill in US history, staining hundreds of miles of shoreline, hurting fisherman and businesses and prompting new rules for deepwater drilling. BP has already spent or committed tens of billions of dollars to clean up the mess and compensate victims. The Transocean report was the culmination of work by an internal investigation team comprised of experts from various technical fields and other specialists. Transocean said the loss of evidence with the rig and the unavailability of certain witnesses limited its investigation and analysis in some areas. The findings conclude: • BP did not properly communicate to the drill crew the lack of testing on the cement or the uncertainty surrounding critical tests and procedures used to confirm the integrity of the barriers intended to inhibit the flow from the well. • BP adopted a technically complex nitrogen foam cement programme for sealing the well. The resulting cementing job was of minimal quantity, left little margin for error, and was not tested adequately before or after the cementing operation. Further, the integrity of the cement may have been compromised by contamination, instability, and an inadequate number of devices used to center the casing in the wellbore. • Cement contractor Halliburton and BP did not adequately test the cement slurry used to seal the well.",5893c8d8ee42414dea6ea478
2017-02-03T12:03:43Z,theguardian.com,2008-06-12,"environment, conservation.wildlife1","Severn barrage will be costly ecological disaster, say environment groups",1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/12/conservation.wildlife1,"Britain's largest environment groups have strongly rejected plans for a massive £15bn tidal barrage across the Severn that would provide about 5% of the UK's annual electricity demand and help the government meet climate-change targets. In the first shots of what is expected to become one of the fiercest environmental battles in years, the groups, which include the National Trust, the RSPB and WWF, but not Greenpeace, have challenged the government to find cheaper and less destructive ways of generating renewable electricity from the estuary. Britain will need to generate nearly 40% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2020 to meet its EU targets, and a 10-mile long tidal barrage with 200 turbines between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare is widely seen in government as one of the most attractive options. Plans for a barrage have been proposed for more than 100 years. But the coalition of 10 groups, with a membership of more than 5 million people, says a barrage would be economically dubious and ecologically disastrous. It would, the coalition says, destroy nearly 86,486 acres (35,000 ha) of highly protected wetlands across the estuary. More power could be generated more cheaply by using other green technologies, the group says. Their report, commissioned from the economics consultancy Frontier Economics, follows a study last year by the government's environmental advisers, the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC). The commission found in favour of a barrage on condition that it be state funded and that the lost wetlands be compensated for elsewhere. The government is now doing its own feasibility studies. The report challenges the idea that tidal energy from the Severn would be best for Britain. ""The cycle of the tides in the Severn means that a barrage would not necessarily provide electricity at peak times."" It also suggests 5m tonnes of CO2 will be emitted during construction and another 5m tonnes emitted during transport of the materials - undermining claims that the barrage would help reduce emissions. The group says that the real cost could be much higher than the widely quoted £15bn. ""This does not take into account costs of land acquisition in Cardiff and Weston or the creation of new wildlife habitats to compensate for the lost land."" The coalition also rejects the SDC condition that the barrage be built and run by the state as it would be of such national importance. This, says the report's author, Matthew Bell, would not be permitted under Treasury rules, and would not, anyway, warrant special government subsidies or other forms of public investment. Bell said: ""It is hard to think of reasons for the public sector to build or operate a barrage which would not be equally applicable to many other projects and assets that sit in the private sector. Not only is the private sector more than able to finance a scheme of this scale but, even using the most conservative estimates of costs, the barrage is one of the most expensive options for clean energy generation there is."" Graham Wynne, chief executive of the RSPB, said: ""There are good reasons for trying to harness the energy potential of the Severn estuary. But the estuary is truly exceptional for its ecological value. The [SDC] has already confirmed that a barrage would fundamentally change the nature of the estuary. Frontier's report shows that this exorbitantly expensive and massively damaging proposal cannot be justified on economic grounds - there are simply too many cheaper options for clean energy generation."" Tony Burton, strategy director at the National Trust, said: ""The Severn estuary is a unique and valuable asset, rich in wildlife and striking landscapes. While we support strong action to tackle climate change, we need to do this in a cost-effective way and respect the importance of our natural environment. This study demonstrates that the government should consider other ways of meeting our renewable targets which make better use of public money and are at less cost to the environment."" The land that would be submerged hosts about 68,000 birds in winter, including huge flocks of dunlins and shelducks, together with Bewick's swans, curlews, pintails, wigeons and redshanks. Breeding birds feeding on the estuary in summer include curlews, shelducks and oystercatchers. At least 30,000 salmon and tens of thousands of shads, lampreys and sea trout use the estuary to reach spawning grounds in the Usk and Wye rivers. Eels swim back down these rivers to reach spawning grounds at sea and millions of elvers return in the spring.",5893c8dfee424150a7e42a83
2017-02-03T12:04:46Z,theguardian.com,2012-04-16,environment,Wildlife and farming disaster warning as drought spreads across England,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/16/drought-wildlife-farming-disaster-warning,"Most of England is now in drought and the dry spell could last beyond Christmas, the Environment Agency will announce on Monday, as government officials started planning for a long-term water shortage that could be disastrous for wildlife, the landscape and farming. Large swaths of the Midlands and the south-west have entered official drought status, meaning water companies in those areas can apply to place restrictions on water use for households and businesses. This could mean an extension of the hosepipe bans in the south of England. The drought now extends from Cornwall to Kent, East Anglia to Shropshire and Herefordshire, and as far north as Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and North Yorkshire. Even parts of Wales – normally one of the wettest parts of the UK – are reporting ill-effects from the dry spell. The smattering of rain in many areas over Easter gave little respite from low river flows and falling groundwater levels, with only England's northernmost counties still getting enough wet weather. While rain over the summer and autumn could alleviate the water shortages, officials are planning for the third dry winter in a row, which could devastate wildlife and farming. Only a very wet autumn and winter could prevent the drought stretching into next year. Soils are so dry that they will need a prolonged heavy soaking to recover, while levels at reservoir across much of England are so low they will take time to replenish. Trevor Bishop, head of water resources at the Environment Agency, warned the outlook was bleak. ""A longer term drought, lasting until Christmas and perhaps beyond, now looks more likely, and we are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought,"" he said. ""While we've had some welcome rain recently, the problem has not gone away and we would urge everyone – right across the country – to use water wisely now, which will help prevent more serious impacts next year."" Households and businesses in areas not yet badly affected, and not under hosepipe bans, are also being urged to save water. Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, said: ""As more areas of the UK move into drought it is vital we use less water to protect the public's water supply in the driest areas of the country. It is for everyone to share the responsibility to save water. We are asking everyone to help by using less water and starting now."" Helen Vale, national drought co-ordinator at the Environment Agency, added: ""The amount of water that we use at home and in our businesses has a direct effect on the amount of water available in the environment, for wildlife and for farmers, so we would urge everyone to start using less water now, whether or not they live in an area with a hosepipe ban."" The state of restrictions varies widely. While most of the south-east is under a hosepipe ban, the south-west – despite being now officially in drought – has more reservoirs and fewer people. South West Water has no plans to restrict consumer usage as its reservoirs are at 84% of their capacity. Farmers, particularly arable farmers and vegetable growers, face a difficult summer as decisions have already been taken on what to grow this year. Further restrictions such as curbs on abstracting groundwater will become more likely if the drought continues. Price rises are likely for thirsty crops such as soft fruit and vegetables, while the price of beer is also expected to increase. Wildlife is being hard hit across the south of England, with little that can be done for many species. Amphibians such as frogs, toads and newts are particularly at risk, as their breeding season has been hit by the drying out of ponds and ditches, and fish have died in large numbers after becoming trapped in diminishing pools as the river flow fell. Although some fish have been moved from some of the most drought-stricken spots, government agencies lack the means to carry this out on the vast scale that would be needed in a prolonged drought. Species from water voles and wildfowl to dragonflies and wading birds will also be hit, wildlife experts have warned, as the drought reduces their habitats, kills off food supplies and leaves them vulnerable to predators and disease. Wildfires – more likely as vegetation dries out – may also pose a danger if hot weather continues this summer. Welcome though rain would be, sudden showers also carry risks, the Environment Agency warned, as flash floods become more likely when soil is dry. England needs rain – but the right kind of rain.",5893c91eee424132f8fd7403
2017-02-03T12:05:02Z,theguardian.com,2010-06-07,environment,Bhopal disaster criminal court verdicts to be delivered,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/07/bhopal-disaster-criminal-verdicts,"An Indian court is set to deliver a historic judgment on the Bhopal gas disaster, one of the worst modern industrial accidents. Over 25 years after a leak from a chemical plant owned by Union Carbide Corporation, a US company, killed up to 25,000 people and harmed hundreds of thousands more in the central Indian city, the city judicial magistrate of Bhopal will today decide whether a dozen senior managers and directors of the plant should go to jail. The verdict will be the first in a criminal prosecution connected to the tragedy. Those in the dock are all Indian. The trial was split following the refusal of the then chairman Union Carbide, Warren Anderson, who is American, to return to India to face charges. Those in the dock are now accused of causing death by criminal negligence and face a sentence of up to two years' imprisonment if found guilty. Original charges of culpable homicide, which carries a potential 10-year sentence, were controversially downgraded by the supreme court in 1996. Anderson remains charged with the more serious offence. The trial has involved 178 witnesses and over 3,000 documents. The prosecution has sought to show that the accident was a result of the Bhopal plant's defective design and poor maintenance. Groups representing the survivors of the disaster have criticized the prosecution case, brought by the state through India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which they say has been poorly prepared. The disaster was caused when late in the evening of 2 December 1984, safety systems failed, allowing methyl isocyanate, a key ingredient for pesticide, to mix with water at high temperatures. Poorly trained and ill-equipped local staff were unable to prevent the subsequent release of clouds of highly toxic gas. Worst hit were the densely-populated slum areas which had grown up around the plant since its construction in 1969. Groups representing the survivors of the tragedy say that those responsible should face more serious sanctions. ""Justice will be done in Bhopal only if the individuals and corporations responsible are punished in an exemplary manner,"" said Rashida Bee, who lost six family members in the disaster. ""Union Carbide's disaster was foreseeable and foreseen and still allowed to happen."" One defendant, Vijay Gokhale, who was managing director of the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation at the time, told the local Sunday Mid Day newspaper that the accused were not ""nervous"" about the end of the trial. ""We all hope there is some kind of closure,"" he said. The number of casualties caused by the disaster remains disputed. The Madhya Pradesh government has confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths. Campaigners say more than six times as many were killed and nearly 250,000 harmed. A 2004 Amnesty International report said around 100,000 people in Bhopal continue to suffer ""chronic and debilitating illnesses"". Many have received little compensation. A deal struck by the Indian government with Union Carbide was based on an early estimate of victims that proved extremely low. Defendants will be able to appeal today's verdict.",5893c92eee42414e83d61d2a
2017-02-03T12:09:10Z,theguardian.com,2012-03-30,environment,Toxic pollen and the mad bee disease disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/toxic-pollen-mad-bee-disease,"In July 1994, French beekeepers reported that their honeybee population had displayed strange, agitated behaviour and had ""melted away"". ""Mad bee disease,"" as it quickly became known, was thought to have caused the death of 40% of bee colonies and beekeepers looking for an explanation for the catastrophe began pointing the finger at a new type of pesticide. Systemic pesticides are those that are transported in the sap of a plant from the seed up through the stem into the leaves and flowers. Here, they contaminate nectar and pollen and hence any insect that picks them up – including bees. Since then, imidacloprid and other neonicotinoid systemic pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, have been implicated in the worldwide collapse of honeybee colonies. As well as being systemic, they act as a neurotoxin attacking an insect's nervous system on contact or ingestion and are designed to protect over 140 commercial crops, including cereals, oilseed rape, maize, cotton, sunflower and sugar beet. any beekeepers believe the pesticides' presence at sub-lethal doses in nectar and pollen collected by foraging honeybees has wiped out bee populations. David Hackenberg, the commercial US beekeeper credited with discovering the strange phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder, when he opened his 400 hives in Florida in 2006 to find his bees had disappeared, has always blamed systemic pesticides. And he is not alone. But until now their culpability has been difficult to prove. Laboratory and semi-field studies in France and Italy have shown that imidacloprid can disorientate foraging bees and impair their memory and communication so that they don't return home with food and the colonies in the hive dwindle and die. But the pesticide's manufacturer Bayer, has always maintained that bees are given much higher doses in trials than they would come into contact with in the field. In contrast, its own research concluded that Gaucho (an imidacloprid seed treatment) ""caused neither a reduced visitation of flowers nor an increased loss of foraging honeybees"" and found ""no records of behaviourally impaired honeybees"". It also argues that so many factors affect bee health, including parasites, viruses and malnutrition, that there is no one single assailant. Most scientists and governments around the world seem to share this view. They were quick to dismiss pesticides as the likely cause when colony collapse disorder hit the headlines in 2007 and resources were invested trying to discover new killer-bee viruses. In France, Gaucho was banned on sunflower and corn seeds but large-scale bee deaths have continued, supporting Bayer's claims that its products aren't guilty of killing bees. But by then bees were coming into contact with another ""neonic"" thiamethoxam, manufactured by Syngenta. Italian apiarists accused the pesticide of massacring their bees and independent studies have shown it can adversely affect bees' flight behaviour. A spokesman for Syngenta said: ""Although we take good research very seriously, over the last four years, independent authorities in France have closely monitored the use of Cruiser – the product containing thiamethoxam – on more than 1.9m hectares. When properly used no cases of bee mortality have been recorded."" Yet it is only now, with the alarming results of these two new groundbreaking trials that expose honeybees and bumblebees for the first time to field-realistic sub-lethal levels of neonics that we can say with confidence what many beekeepers have instinctively known for years, that these pesticides do contribute to the death of bee colonies. It is a step nearer to revealing the truth of what is killing our vital pollinators and to what we can do to prevent their deaths.

2017-02-03T12:10:12Z,theguardian.com,2007-04-04,"environment, energy.indonesia",Palm oil: the biofuel of the future driving an ecological disaster now,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/apr/04/energy.indonesia,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday April 11 2007 The estimated emissions from fires in degraded peatlands in Indonesia are 1,400m tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum and not, as we stated in the article below, 1,400 tonnes. This has been corrected. The numbers are damning. Within 15 years 98% of the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia will be gone, little more than a footnote in history. With them will disappear some of the world's most important wildlife species, victims of the rapacious destruction of their habitat in what conservationists see as a lost cause. Yet this gloomy script was supposed to have included a small but significant glimmer of hope. Oil palm for biofuel was to have been one of the best solutions in saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming. Instead the forests are being torn down in the headlong rush to boost palm oil production. More startling is that conservationists believe the move to clear land for this ""green fuel"" is often little more than a conspiracy, providing cover to strip out the last stands of timber not already lost to illegal loggers. In one corner of Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, a mere 250,000 hectares or 1,000 sq miles...-... almost twice the size of Greater London...-...of the 6m hectares of forest allocated for palm oil by the government have actually been planted. ""When you look closely the areas where companies are getting permission for oil palm plantations are those of high-conservation forest,"" said Willie Smits, who set up SarVision, a satellite mapping service that charts the rainforest's decline. ""What they're really doing is stealing the timber because they get to clear it before they plant. But the timber's all they want; hit and run with no intention of ever planting. It's a conspiracy."" The fear is that Indonesia's aim of almost doubling the 6.5m hectares under oil palm plantation in the next five to eight years - tripling it by 2020 - to meet rocketing worldwide demand will afford ever-greater opportunities for the timber thieves. An estimated 2.8m hectares of forest is already lost every year. Until now palm oil - of which 83% is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia - was produced for food. But the European Union's aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, partly by demanding that 10% of vehicles be fuelled by biofuels, will see a fresh surge in palm oil demand that could doom the rainforests. That is likely to kill off the ""flagship species"" of wildlife such as the Asian elephant, the Sumatran tiger and the orang-utan of Borneo which are already under enormous pressure from habitat loss. Plantation owners regard the orang-utan as pests because it eats the young palm oil plants and hunt them down ruthlessly. ""In reality it's over for the tiger, the elephant and the orang-utan,"" said Mr Smits, who founded the Borneo Orang-utan Survival Foundation. ""Their entire lowland forest habitat is essentially gone already. We find orang-utan burned, or their heads cut off. Hunters are paid 150,000 rupiah [£8.30] for the right hand of an orang-utan to prove they've killed them."" Two orang-utan rehabilitation centres run by the foundation on Indonesian Borneo are overflowing with more than 800 of the primates, most rescued from oil palm plantations. But the east Kalimantan centre, where rescued babies are reared by hand, has been unable to release any rescued orang-utan into the wild for four years because suitable habitat has proved impossible to find. In central Kalimantan the picture is worse: it has never staged a release in almost a decade. A new UN report The Last Stand of the Orangutan: State of Emergency found that forests in Indonesia and Malaysia are being felled so quickly that 98% could be gone by 2022. Yet the orang-utan's lowland forest could disappear much sooner. ""We're looking at the virtual extinction of the orang-utan in 15 years, or less,"" said Raffaella Commitante, primatologist at the foundation's east Kalimantan centre. ""There are between 50,000 and 60,000 on Borneo and 7,000 on Sumatra. But 5,000 -10,000 are killed each year."" Yet palm oil, mixed with diesel to produce biofuel, was hailed as a potential saviour for the environment. Put simply, the argument runs that the palm oil plants produce organic compounds that when burned in engines do not add to overall carbon dioxide levels. The CO2 absorbed by the plant in its life-cycle should balance the amount it gives out when burned. However, the more the ecological fairytale is scrutinised the more it begins to look like a bad dream. Researchers from the Dutch pressure group Wetlands International found that as much as half the space created for new palm oil plantations was cleared by draining and burning peat-land, sending huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The sodden peat of central Kalimantan acts as a vast organic sponge that stores huge amounts of carbon. But as it dries while being drained for plantation, or by roads being cut through to remove timber, it releases the stored carbon. In Indonesia alone, the peat releases 600m tonnes of carbon a year. Worse, it is often set alight to speed clearing, adding to the CO2 from the huge forest fires that blanket much of south-east Asia in haze. Estimates say Indonesia's fires generate 1,400m tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, pushing it to the world's third-largest producer of CO2 from 26th, if both factors are considered. Conservationists also fear that placing all eggs in one basket could prompt an ecological disaster. A palm oil monoculture would be unable to support the rich diversity of wildlife and leave the environment vulnerable to catastrophic disease, while local people dependent on the crop could be left high and dry if it fell out of favour. ""There are bad biofuels in the world and palm oil is often the very 'baddest',"" said Ed Matthew, biofuel specialist at Friends of the Earth. ""Europe shouldn't be setting targets until it's put a mechanism in place to block bad biofuels. Palm oil is one of the cheapest biofuels in the field, but by setting targets it sends the wrong signal for businessmen."" As the risks become more obvious there has been a growing clamour for eco-labelling of ""sustainable"" palm oil. A ""round table"" of buyers, producers and environmentalists has established several key criteria that would prevent conversion of high-conservation rainforest to palm oil plantations, cut the use of fires to clear land, and mitigate the conflict of plantations with wildlife and rural communities, though it has yet to be ratified. ""It's vital we find financial backing for this now,"" said Fitrian Ardiansyah, a Worldwide Fund for Nature-Indonesia programme officer. Jakarta is increasingly aware of the dangers, highlighted by its inability to prevent continuing illegal logging. But it is keen to grab the chance and is pledging to put in place regulations to seize allocated palm oil land not planted within a time limit. Yet as a developing country it also believes Europe must help out financially if it wants the safeguards against the downside of palm oil production that will assist in cutting greenhouse gas. ""The Indonesian government simply doesn't have the capability or the capacity to do this alone without the support of the Europeans, the US, Japanese, or whoever,"" said Alhilal Hamdi, chief executive of Indonesia's biofuels development board. ""It's no good other countries looking to us to help cut their CO2 emissions without helping to support us in that effort.""",5893ca64ee42415149dc6251
2017-02-03T12:11:40Z,theguardian.com,2006-03-10,"environment, naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment",UN launches $500m disaster relief fund,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/mar/10/naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment,"The UN launched an emergency response fund yesterday for natural and man-made disasters to try to establish a permanent pool of $500m (£288m) that can be quickly channelled to emergencies as they happen. Britain has taken a lead in the initiative by providing $70m. UN officials said it took four months for the world to provide aid after Sudan lifted restrictions on helping displaced people in the western region of Darfur. During that period the number of people in need of emergency help rose to 1.6 million. In 2004, when locusts devastated crops in the Sahel, a $9m appeal by the Food and Agriculture Organisation to spray the insects and prevent their spread, failed to get enough funds. As a result the locusts multiplied in eight countries and the FAO had to raise its appeal to $100m. Twenty-two countries have pledged $193m to the new central emergency response fund so far. Britain's contribution is the biggest. In one sense, the new fund is simply a renaming of an existing fund. But the present central emergency revolving fund has only $50m in resources, making it hard to respond adequately and in time. ""The goal of the fund is simple: to provide aid workers with sufficient funding to jump-start lifesaving relief operations and to immediately deploy staff, goods and services for people in need when most lives are on the line,"" said Jan Egeland, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha). ""Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."" Money from the fund should be released immediately to help save lives in the growing food crises in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, Hilary Benn, Britain's international development secretary, said at the fund's launch in New York. ""All too often, as we have seen with the tragedies in Darfur and Niger, it takes the media's spotlight to prompt countries to pledge funds,"" he said. ""Now, with this new single source of rapid funding, there should be less forgotten crises and less focus on passing around the begging bowl when crises do strike, so saving time and people's lives.""",5893cabcee424152183c69e4

The threats of rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms, floods, droughts and heat waves cannot be ignored; weather-related disasters increased from 200 in 1995 to 400 in 2006. But even if emissions are brought under control, in the short term this trend is likely to continue. The British Red Cross believes any plans to combat climate change must include investment in supporting people to prepare for and recover from episodes of severe weather. Those hit hardest by the effects of climate change have contributed least to the problem - the poorest and most vulnerable people in the poorest countries. As the EU and governments around the world seek to balance their economic needs with environmental demands, we are calling for governments to guarantee a sufficient proportion of spending for local disaster resilience, to support local people through the anticipated crises. Matthias Schmale British Red Cross Yes, clean water is vital after an earthquake or hurricane (From gunk to drink, the life saving water bottle, March 12). But no, the response is not to fly in plane-loads of water. What we do is repair and clean existing water sources. It is simple, it is straightforward and, per litre of clean water, much cheaper than the latest line of technological fixes. Your story wasn't an April fool spoof, was it?

They will suffer ever worse climate disasters, desertification and flooding as a result of inadequate targets for reducing emissions from many of the world's richest nations. And they are set to lose millions of hectares of rainforest, grasslands and farming land so that Europe can meet a 10% biofuel target. Already, up to 20m hectares of land face being converted to oil palm plantations in Indonesia alone, and forests across Latin America, Africa and Asia face destruction as Europe pushes up world market prices for soya, palm oil and sugar cane. While wind and solar are truly clean energy forms and offer real emission cuts, the energy plan contains no specific mechanism to support them. Nor does it suggest any credible ways of reducing energy demand. Mandatory targets are proposed only for biofuels. Yet biofuels linked to deforestation and peat drainage can have far higher carbon emissions than the fossil fuels they replace: a recent study shows that palm-oil biodiesel from south-east Asian peatlands has 10 times the emissions of mineral oil. Commissioners have ignored the European parliament's demand for strict environmental safeguards, and an open letter from hundreds of Latin American NGOs, demanding that Europe must not solve its problems at the expense of the environment and communities in the global south. If the commission's plans are endorsed, this will almost certainly speed up the destruction of the Amazon and of other ancient forests across the globe, and leave millions of poor people without land to grow food.

A defensive Ken Feinberg, under fire from the Obama administration, Gulf leaders and local business for the slow pace of payouts for losses due to the BP spill, said the vast majority of the 130,000 unsettled claims did not have adequate documentation. ""Here is the problem that I continually have to address … roughly 80% of the claims that we now have in the queue lack proof,"" Feinberg told foreign reporters in Washington. ""That is a huge number."" Feinberg did not rule out settling claims in the future, but he added: ""The claims that were denied had woeful, inadequate or no documentation to speak of."" He indicated that BP is unlikely to pay out more than the initial $20bn (£12.3bn)agreed for the compensation fund in a meeting at the White House last summer. ""I am cautiously optimistic that $20bn will be enough,"" he said. Any funds remaining from the $20bn would revert to BP under an agreement with the White House, Feinberg said: ""My understanding is that if $20bn is sufficient and there is money left over it is retained by BP. That is not on my watch, that is not my responsibility."" The Obama administration, state governments, and local businesses have grown increasingly frustrated with Feinberg's handling of the claims process. Since August, Feinberg has paid out nearly $3.6bn to some 168,000 individuals and businesses in the Gulf. The state governments of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida accuse Feinberg of stalling claims, causing hardship to local businesses. They also accuse Feinberg of under-estimating losses to local businesses. They have asked the courts to order emergency payments. Earlier this month, a New Orleans judge ordered Feinberg to stop calling himself an independent operator, as BP pays his law firm $850,000 a month to oversee the compensation fund. BP meanwhile said Feinberg has been overly generous. Feinberg, on the defensive, told reporters that most of his estimates were based on the assumption that the Gulf would make a full recovery by the end of next year . However, the fishing and tourist industries, which were badly damaged by the spill, claim it will take much longer to recover.",5893cf2dee42414dea6ebfaa
2017-02-03T12:43:11Z,theguardian.com,2011-01-06,"environment, oil-oil",MPs publish report on lessons from BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster,1.3,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/06/oil-oil,"British taxpayers could end up footing the clean-up bill from any major oil spill in UK waters because current rules allow companies to dodge their environmental responsibilities, according to MPs investigating BP's Gulf of Mexico disaster. And the government ought to require companies to prove that they can pay out billions of pounds in clean-up costs before they are granted exploration and production licences, recommends the committee's final report, which is published today. It also points to ""serious doubts"" over whether companies' plans to respond to spills – by capping leaking wells and skimming oil from the sea surface – would work in the rough Atlantic waters off the west coast of Shetland. The report points to the ""limitations"" of the computer modelling used by oil companies to predict the long-term effects of spills at sea. The Guardian has obtained documents relating to the oil spill response plan of US company Chevron which, in October, was given consent to drill off Shetland. It showed that its modelling software could not simulate spills lasting more than 14 days without crashing. The Gulf of Mexico spill lasted almost three months. The energy and climate change committee held several hearings last year, with witnesses from the oil industry – including BP's former chief executive Tony Hayward – environmentalists and politicians all giving evidence. Its report (UK Deepwater Drilling: Implications of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill) into what lessons could be learned from the BP disaster largely exonerates the UK's industry and regulatory regime, which it said was much tougher than the one that oversaw the Gulf of Mexico. But it attacks the voluntary oil spill clean-up fund set up by the industry, which can pay out a maximum of $250m (£161m) per year, as ""insufficient"". It only covers ""direct damage"" the definition of which the report says is not clear. ""While membership of the Offshore Pollution Liability Association [Opol] remains voluntary ... [that] voluntary nature weakens its legality and the control and deployment of its funds. We believe this lack of legal control will allow polluters to claim that damages to biodiversity and ecosystems are indirect, and therefore do not qualify for compensation."" The report adds: ""We conclude there needs to be clarity on the identity and hierarchy of liable parties to ensure that the government, and hence the taxpayer, do not have to pay for the consequences of offshore incidents."" The report also says that EU legislation obliging companies to meet their responsibilities over a spill is vague and inconsistent and ""unlikely to bring to account those responsible for environmental damage caused by an offshore incident such as happened in the Gulf of Mexico"". It adds that the government should work with the EU to draw up new legislation based on the ""polluter pays"" principle. It says that a moratorium on drilling in the UK, as some environmentalists have recommended, would be bad for the British economy. In December Barack Obama, the US president, angered the oil industry when he banned new drilling off the east coast and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. However, the committee, which is chaired by Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP and former environment minister, said that the British regulator should consider requiring all blow-out preventers to have a double, rather than a single, set of blind shear rams, which are supposed to cut through the drill pipe to close off the well in the event of a blow-out. BP's Deepwater Horizon only had one set of blind shear rams, which failed to activate, rendering the blow-out preventer – the last line of defence against a major spill – useless. Charles Hendry, the energy minister, said that the government would carry out another review of the British offshore safety regime once US investigations had been concluded. Trade body Oil and Gas UK said it was against a requirement for double shear rams and disagreed on the report's claims on industry clean up funding. The report also urges the government and oil companies to stop the intimidation of rig workers into not reporting safety concerns. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) accused Transocean, the American rig owner at the centre of BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, of compromising safety in the North Sea by ""bullying, harassment and intimidation"" of its staff.",5893d21fee42414dea6ecc35
